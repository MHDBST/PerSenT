4550,UPDATE 6,Donald Trump,"term extension of government funding that would avert a politically embarrassing shutdown   after  President Donald Trump  offered mixed signals on the stopgap plan .  Trump  complicated the talks by saying a six - year extension of funding for the Children ' s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP )  a Democratic priority   should not be included . The White House later said  the president  fully backed the proposal pending in the House of Representatives   which includes the insurance plan . Given opposition in both parties   it was still unclear on Thursday if Congress could head off a weekend shutdown of the federal government   which is operating on its third temporary funding extension since the 2018 fiscal year began on Oct . 1 . Negotiators have scrambled to reach a budget deal that would include Democratic efforts to protect young immigrants known as "" Dreamers  "" who were brought to the country illegally as children   and satisfy conservatives who want to raise spending for the military . Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said they were optimistic the House later on Thursday would approve funding until Feb . 16 . A procedural House vote to approve the rules for debate passed 226 - 194 . But some Republicans were not so certain the continuing resolution had enough support for approval . Republican Representative Mark Meadows   who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus   told reporters : "" I promise you that ' s not the case "" that the speaker had enough Republican votes to pass the bill . Questions about Trump ' s support arose earlier on Thursday   when he said on Twitter that "" CHIP should be part of a long term solution   not a 30 Day   or short term   extension !"" That led the White House to issue a statement saying Trump was still on board with the House proposal . Asked if Trump ' s statements were making it more likely Republicans would be blamed for a shutdown   Republican Senator Jeff Flake   a frequent Trump critic   said simply : "" Yes ."" With the threat of a shutdown looming   some senators began to discuss the possibility of short one - or two - day extensions to allow negotiations to continue without stopping government operations . "" I think some of our members would like to see us negotiate the bigger deal and do a short - term CR for a few days  "" Republican Senator John Thune said . PREPARING FOR THE WORST Some government agencies began to prepare for a possible shutdown . The U . S . Government Accountability Office sent its employees a memo on Thursday warning that regular operations would cease on Monday if a shutdown occurred . If money were to run out   many federal agencies would be shut down and workers sent home . But "" essential services "" dealing with public safety and national security would continue . McConnell said he anticipated the House would pass the temporary funding bill and the Senate would take it up after that . "" Shouldn ’ t be a difficult vote . There ’ s nothing   nothing in such a continuing resolution that my Democratic friends actually oppose  "" he said . Democrats have insisted   however   a long - term spending bill must include a measure covering the "" Dreamers  "" who were protected from deportation under former President Barack Obama ' s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program .  Trump  ordered DACA to end in March and asked Congress to come up with a legislative fix . But bipartisan congressional negotiations with the White House faltered last week   prompting Republican leaders to begin pushing for the passage of the stopgap measure . Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized  Trump  for taking a trip to Pennsylvania on Thursday to campaign for a Republican House candidate rather than staying for the negotiations . He said the House bill to fund the government was “ very likely to be unacceptable to the Senate .""

Republicans hold a 51 - 49 majority in the Senate and most legislation   including spending bills or an immigration deal   will require 60 votes to pass . Republican Senator Lindsey Graham   who is involved in the immigration negotiations   and conservative colleague Mike Rounds have said they will not vote for a short - term funding bill .

4552,AP News in Brief at 6:04 a.m. EST,Donald Trump,Trump   Xi present united front despite differences BEIJING —  President Donald Trump  sought to present a united front with Chinese President Xi Jinping following two days of meetings Thursday   despite lingering differences over trade and North Korea . On trade    Trump  criticized the “ very one - sided and unfair ” trade relationship between the U . S . and China but stopped short of castigating Xi by saying he doesn ’ t blame the country for having taken advantage of the U . S .  Trump  said China “ must immediately address the unfair trade practices that drive ” what  he  said is a “ shockingly ” large trade deficit   along with barriers to market access   forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft . “ But I don ’ t blame China  ”  he  said . “ After all   who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens ?” To applause    Trump  said : “ I give China great credit .”  His  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered a blunter assessment of China ’ s trade surplus with the United States   which in October widened by 12 . 2 percent from a year earlier   to $ 26 . 6 billion . The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $ 223 billion . ___  Trump  cooperates with Chinese effort to control image BEIJING — U . S .  President Donald Trump  was a cooperative partner for Beijing ’ s sweeping efforts to control the message of  his  heavily choreographed visit to China . Trump and  his  Chinese counterpart   Xi Jinping   took no questions at an event Thursday billed as a news briefing   a reduction of already minimal press interaction during previous visits by American leaders . During a 2014 visit by then President Barack Obama   Xi took a symbolic single question from a reporter for a Chinese state newspaper . He brushed off an American reporter ’ s question about whether Beijing might ease restrictions on journalist visas   saying vaguely that media outlets had to obey China ’ s laws . Trump   who has called the media the “ enemy of the American people  ” also took no questions during an event at which Chinese companies signed contracts to buy American jetliners   soybeans and other goods . Trump ’ s visit comes at a time when he faces uncomfortable questions at home about Russia and possible gun controls following deadly mass shootings . ___ North Korea   ever so cautiously   is going online PYONGYANG   North Korea — Ever so cautiously   North Korea is going online . Doctors can consult via live   online video conferencing   and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes . People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones . In the wallets of the privileged are “ Jonsong ” or “ Narae ” cards for e - shopping and online banking . Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web . It ’ s just not the World Wide Web . This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium - sized company might use for its employees . The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes   and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea   North Korea is still the least Internet - friendly country on Earth . Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable . Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn ’ t shared   and the price for trying to get around the government ’ s rules can be severe . But for Kim Jong Un   the country ’ s first leader to come of age with the Internet   the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive . It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology — and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of . It also allows for the possibility of cyber - attacks on the West . ___ Pence   Abbott attend vigil for victims of church shooting SUTHERLAND SPRINGS   Texas — Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov . Greg Abbott at a memorial service for the victims of Sunday ’ s massacre at a small - town Texas church . Pence told the crowd Wednesday evening that the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs was the worst mass shooting at a church in American history and called the gunman “ deranged .” “ Whatever animated the evil that descended on that small church   of the attacker ’ s desire was to silence their testimony of faith   they failed  ” the vice president added . Abbott began the service by praying “ for healing and for help .” The governor said that Texans come together at times of crisis and tragedy . “ It ’ s what we do  ” Abbott said . People in the crowd responded “ amen .” ___ Las Vegas shooting victims still searching for their heroes LOS ANGELES — As soon as Chris Gilman knew she would survive the gunshot wound she sustained in the Las Vegas massacre   she wanted to find the two strangers who saved her life — a man and woman whose names she didn ’ t even know . She found a Facebook page called “ Find My LV Hero ” and posted a plea . “ Looking for husband and wife who were by the VIP bleachers and helped me get out  ” wrote Gilman   of Bonney Lake   Washington . “ My wife gave the husband her shirt and the wife held it against my side to stop bleeding as they carried me through the VIP area out to the street .” Despite the scant details in Gilman ’ s post   it worked . Three days later   Gilman connected with her rescuers   Alex and Wanda Valiente   off - duty Los Angeles County sheriff ’ s deputies who were at the Oct . 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel   killing 58 people and wounding hundreds . The connection is one of about 25 made so far through the Facebook page . Nearly six weeks after the massacre   Ashton Zyer ’ s social media creation continues to generate new searches for heroes who in some cases saved lives and in others simply provided what comfort they could . ___ IS militants evacuate last stronghold in Syria to government BEIRUT — A Syrian war monitor says Islamic State militants have withdrawn from their last stronghold following a government offensive . The Britain - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says government forces and allied troops   including Iraqi fighters   are combing Boukamal   a strategic town on the border with Iraq   on Thursday after IS militants withdrew . Syrian pro - government media say Syrian troops had clashed with remnants of IS militants in the town after they entered it late Wednesday . On Thursday   they declared the town totally free of the militants . The fall of Boukamal means remaining IS militants are currently holed up in small towns and villages along the border with Iraq and in the Syrian desert . ___ Democrats see wins as momentum for 2018 state elections Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year ’ s midterm elections   as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come . Democrats won the governors ’ offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday   erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate . All told   Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since  President Donald Trump  won election last year   reversing several years of Republican momentum . “ In general   this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states  ” said Jessica Post   executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee . She added : “ The other thing it said is we can win all across the country .” The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care   taxes and education   but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn . The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census   and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then . ___ Pomp and flattery : Asia rolls out the red carpets for Trump BEIJING — Honor guards marching in unison in colorful uniforms . Elaborate state dinners with celebrity guests . Gaggles of children   jumping and screaming along with endless praise . The first half of President Donald Trump ’ s whirlwind tour to Asia has been an exercise in the art of flattery   as world leaders woo the man who was introduced at the South Korean National Assembly as the “ leader of the world .” “ They are not ignorant that this is a president who is particularly responsive to flattery  ” said Lindsey Ford of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington   who said the Chinese   in particular   would “ absolutely go over the top ” trying to stroke the president ’ s ego . The pomp and pageantry began in Japan   where  Trump  was welcomed to the grand Akasaka Palace with a welcome ceremony that featured a maze of red carpets   an honor guard and marching band . Prime Minister Shinzo Abe   who has gone out of his way to strike up a personal friendship with  Trump    also treated the president to a round of golf at Japan ’ s premier course   complete with a champion golf partner and a taste of home : a hamburger lunch made with American beef . ___ Christopher Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey in Getty film LOS ANGELES — In a wholly unprecedented move   Kevin Spacey is being cut from Ridley Scott ’ s finished film “ All the Money in the World ” and replaced by Christopher Plummer just over one month before it ’ s supposed to hit theaters . People close to the production who were not authorized to speak publicly said Wednesday that Plummer is commencing reshoots immediately in the role of J . Paul Getty . All of Spacey ’ s scenes will be reshot   the people told The Associated Press . Co - stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams are expected to participate . Scott   who is known to be an efficient director   is intending to keep the film ’ s Dec . 22 release date . The director ’ s publicist Simon Halls confirmed the switch late Wednesday . The film was originally set to have its world premiere at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles on Nov . 16 but was pulled earlier this week amid the sexual harassment reports surrounding Spacey   who has also been fired from “ House of Cards ” and dropped by his talent agency and publicist . ___ Top moments at CMA Awards : Vegas   unity and the monologue Yes   Garth Brooks won entertainer of the year and Chris Stapleton picked up two honors   including album of the year . But the moments that truly dominated the 2017 Country Music Association Awards had less to do with winning   and more about a community banding together to heal . Here ’ s a look at some of the top moments at the awards show   which aired live Wednesday night from the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville   Tennessee . ______ HONORING THE LAS VEGAS VICTIMS The Associated Press .,Trump   Xi present united front despite differences BEIJING —  [TGT]sought to present a united front with Chinese President Xi Jinping following two days of meetings Thursday   despite lingering differences over trade and North Korea .

4555,Trump Keeps Promising Action On Gun Control But Republicans Might Not Be Able To Deliver,Donald Trump,"Republicans in Congress are nowhere near coming together around any plan to address gun violence   nearly two weeks after a school shooting in Florida left 17 dead   and despite President Donald Trump ’ s promises to take action . Returning to Washington Monday after a week on recess   Republicans were divided on a slew of proposals the president has raised   and some questioned whether any reforms are needed at all . “ I don ’ t think we need more gun control  ” Louisiana Sen . John Kennedy told reporters Monday . “ I think we need better idiot control .” Trump   who has been talking to congressional Republicans and lobbyists from the National Rifle Association in recent days   has proposed a broad range of ideas during listening sessions and in tweets   including increasing the age requirement for purchasing certain types of guns   arming some teachers   making changes to the background check system   reopening mental institutions   and banning bump stocks through the Department of Justice . The White House is scheduled to host a bipartisan group of lawmakers Wednesday to come up with a path forward on some of those ideas . “ We continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives  ” Trump said Monday . “ These are incredible people . I visited with a lot of them . But we ’ ll turn our grief into action .” While the media campaign from the young survivors of the Parkland shooting has kept up the pressure on lawmakers to act   many Republicans are still reluctant to push significant changes to gun policy and challenge the NRA   which has five million members — the majority of whom live in conservative districts . In a room with several Republican governors    Trump  said Monday not to worry about the influential group . "" You guys — half of you are so afraid of the NRA  ”  he  said . “ There ' s nothing to be afraid of . And you know what   if they ' re not with you   we have to fight them every once in a while . That ' s OK ."" Despite Trump ’ s lobbying and focus   several Republicans who are strong advocates of the Second Amendment aren ’ t convinced gun control measures will curb mass shootings . Some Republicans   like Arizona Sen . Jeff Flake   who is not running for reelection   are more open to gun control reforms   including raising the age for purchasing some types of guns to 21 . “ This shooting was different  ” Flake told reporters   arguing that it would be hard for Republicans to not bring legislation up for a vote . “ It was amazing to me how quickly it died down after Las Vegas   but this one   with high school kids who have been very articulate in their   you know   in their explanation of what ' s needed and social media and everything else .

Another measure being discussed is the so - called Fix NICS bill   which would strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System . That measure was passed by the House in December   but only after being tied to rules that would allow anyone with a concealed - carry permit to carry concealed weapons across state lines . That made the bill a nonstarter in the Senate . Meadows said at the time Speaker Paul Ryan told the Freedom Caucus there would be no other votes on Fix NICS . Now it is being floated again   but Meadows says the Freedom Caucus has objections over due process fears . Meadows said the legislation as written would allow for guns to be taken away from people who do not have proper channels to defend their mental state . The  Trump  administration   for all of the president ’ s calls to action   has not moved to rally Republicans around any specific proposals   and is yet to provide any language on exactly what they would like Congress to support .  Trump  has said several times  he  ’ d like to strengthen background checks   but the president and  his  aides have declined to say if they support universal background checks   which failed to garner enough votes in Congress in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting . And on raising the age requirements   a measure that the NRA does not support   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday   “ it would be premature for us to weigh in . But   as I said   the president is still supportive of the concept .” Reluctant Republicans could be more willing to get behind the president once he officially backs specific proposals   said South Carolina Sen . Lindsey Graham . “ Anything the president gets behind   because he ' s a Republican president   is a game changer  ” Graham told reporters Monday . “ So if he wants to raise the age to 21   I ' m not so sure that ' s a good idea   but if he got behind it   then you ' re in the ball game ."" Without backing from Republicans in Congress   there is little that the administration can do to curb gun violence . Even on banning bump stocks — the one measure that the president has said he can do through the Department of Justice — it ’ s unclear if the department will have the authority to enforce such a ban   and there are already concerns about the legal battles it could lead to . And Trump ’ s oft mentioned idea to arm thousands of teachers or train them to conceal and carry has proven to be divisive   even among congressional Republicans .

4557,GOP senator: Trump has changed his mind about Russian interference,Donald Trump,When it comes to  the Russia scandal   Donald Trump and his team  have adopted a series of evolving postures . Remember when  they  used to argue – with a straight face – that literally no one from Trump ’ s operation was in communications with Russians during the foreign attack on the American elections ? As it turns out   Trump World doesn ’ t say this anymore . But there ’ s one aspect of the scandal on which the president has been remarkably consistent :  Trump  has rejected the idea that Russia stole Democratic materials in the first place . Indeed   since the moment U . S . intelligence officials briefed the then - Republican candidate on this in 2016    Trump  rejected the claim as folly   going to far as to repeatedly mock American intelligence agencies . No matter how painfully obvious the facts were to everyone on the planet    Trump  refused to accept the most basic detail of the entire controversy . According to Sen . Lindsey Graham ( R - S . C .)  however   all of that has changed . Here ’ s the exchange  he  had yesterday with NBC News ’ Chuck Todd on “ Meet the Press .” GRAHAM : Well   the president does now finally believe that the Russians stole the emails from the DNC and hacked   and Clinton   and the Russians …. The president does believe his intel agencies . Now   it ’ s quite likely that  Trump  and Graham   who appear to now be rather close allies   have had private conversations in which the president has said things to the senator that he hasn ’ t shared with the public . But if  Trump  told Graham he now believes Russians stole Democratic documents   it would represent a dramatic change of heart . As recently as mid - November – not quite two months ago –  Trump  told reporters that Vladimir Putin personally assured  him  that Russia didn ’ t meddle in the American election . “ Every time  he  sees me  he  says   ‘ I didn ’ t do that  ’ and I really believe that when  he  tells me that    he  means it  ” the American president said in reference to his Russian counterpart . It was part of a lengthy pattern in which Trump refused to accept U . S . intelligence agencies ’ findings . “ Nobody really knows for sure ” whether Russia intervened in the American elections   the president said in July – after intelligence professionals told him they do know for sure . But according to Lindsey Graham   sometime between mid - November and early - January   Trump changed his mind   and if the senator is right   the shift is a pretty important development . Indeed   Graham ’ s assertion raises some key follow - up questions for the White House : 1 . Can anyone from Trump World confirm whether Graham is correct ? If so   what finally convinced  Trump  to change his mind ? If  Trump  now believes Putin ’ s government stole American materials in order to influence the outcome of American elections   what does the president intend to do to punish our foreign attackers ? If  Trump  now accepts the intelligence community ’ s findings   does he have any regrets about insulting intelligence agencies for so long ? Should they expect a presidential apology ? Or is it possible Lindsey Graham is carrying water for his new pal   who ’ ll soon make the senator appear foolish by saying the opposite of what the senator claimed yesterday ?,When it comes to  the Russia scandal   [TGT] and [TGT] team  have adopted a series of evolving postures .

S . intelligence officials briefed the then - Republican candidate on this in 2016    [TGT]rejected the claim as folly   going to far as to repeatedly mock American intelligence agencies . No matter how painfully obvious the facts were to everyone on the planet    [TGT]refused to accept the most basic detail of the entire controversy . According to Sen . Lindsey Graham ( R - S . C .)  however   all of that has changed . Here ’ s the exchange  he  had yesterday with NBC News ’ Chuck Todd on “ Meet the Press .” GRAHAM : Well   the president does now finally believe that the Russians stole the emails from the DNC and hacked   and Clinton   and the Russians …. The president does believe his intel agencies . Now   it ’ s quite likely that  [TGT]and Graham   who appear to now be rather close allies   have had private conversations in which the president has said things to the senator that he hasn ’ t shared with the public . But if  [TGT]told Graham he now believes Russians stole Democratic documents   it would represent a dramatic change of heart . As recently as mid - November – not quite two months ago –  [TGT]told reporters that Vladimir Putin personally assured  him  that Russia didn ’ t meddle in the American election . “ Every time  he  sees me  he  says   ‘ I didn ’ t do that  ’ and I really believe that when  he  tells me that    he  means it  ” the American president said in reference to his Russian counterpart . It was part of a lengthy pattern in which [TGT] refused to accept U . S . intelligence agencies ’ findings . “ Nobody really knows for sure ” whether Russia intervened in the American elections   the president said in July – after intelligence professionals told him they do know for sure . But according to Lindsey Graham   sometime between mid - November and early - January   [TGT] changed his mind   and if the senator is right   the shift is a pretty important development . Indeed   Graham ’ s assertion raises some key follow - up questions for the White House : 1 . Can anyone from Trump World confirm whether Graham is correct ? If so   what finally convinced  [TGT]  to change his mind ? If  Trump  now believes Putin ’ s government stole American materials in order to influence the outcome of American elections   what does the president intend to do to punish our foreign attackers ? If  Trump  now accepts the intelligence community ’ s findings   does he have any regrets about insulting intelligence agencies for so long ? Should they expect a presidential apology ? Or is it possible Lindsey Graham is carrying water for his new pal   who ’ ll soon make the senator appear foolish by saying the opposite of what the senator claimed yesterday ?,Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4561,Fact,Donald Trump,President Trump announced his tax plan on Sept . 27 in Indianapolis . We fact checked his address . ( Meg Kelly / The Washington Post ) President Trump ’ s speech on the administration ’ s still - somewhat - vague tax plan   delivered in Indianapolis on Sept . 27   was filled with many of his favorite   inaccurate claims . For instance   he repeatedly says he is offering the “ largest tax cut in our country ’ s history  ” a dubious claim when properly measured as a percentage of the nation ’ s gross domestic product . Here ’ s a sampling of other inaccurate claims — and one case in which he appears to have adjusted his language because of our previous fact checks . “ To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer   we are finally ending the crushing   the horrible   the unfair estate tax   or as it is often referred to   the death tax .” The president ’ s suggestion that “ millions ” of small businesses and farms are affected by the estate tax is absurd . According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center   only about 5   500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million estates — would have to pay any taxes . About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent . That ’ s because for a married couple   about $ 11 million is exempt from taxation . Only 80 — that ’ s right   80 — taxable estates would be farms and small businesses . That ’ s a big change from the past . In 1977   139   000 estates had to pay the tax . In 2000   it was 52   000 . But Congress has kept raising the exemption and lowering the tax rate . So for virtually all Americans   even farms and small businesses   the estate tax is just not a problem . “ Today   our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world .”  Trump  exaggerates here . The United States certainly has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world   currently pegged as high as 39 . 1 percent when including state taxes . ( The federal rate is 35 percent .)  Trump  says  it  is 60 percent higher than “ our average competitor in the developed world  ” comparing 39 . 1 percent to the average rate for the other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   which is 25 . 5 percent when not weighted for GDP . ( It is 31 . 4 percent when weighted for GDP .) But the official rate does not necessarily tell the whole story . What also matters is the actual tax a company pays   after deductions and tax benefits . That is known as the effective tax rate   which can be calculated differently depending on the survey . According to the Congressional Research Service   the effective rate for the United States is 27 . 1 percent   compared with an effective GDP - weighted average of 27 . 7 percent for the OECD . “ Although the U . S . statutory tax rate is higher   the average effective rate is about the same   and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher  ” the CRS says . The Congressional Budget Office   when it examined the issue   said the U . S . effective tax rate was 18 . 6 percent   which it said was among the highest of the biggest economic powers   the Group of 20 . “ Americans waste so much money   billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code . More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes .” Kudos to Trump for updating a formerly misleading phrase that “ more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes .” This 90 percent figure refers to people who file taxes by hiring professionals or using tax software   such as Turbo Tax   which helps people file their taxes on their own . According to the National Taxpayer Advocate ’ s 2016 report   54 percent of individual taxpayers pay preparers and about 40 percent of individual taxpayers use software that costs about $ 50 or more . Still   it ’ s worth pointing out that there are more options now for people to easily file their taxes   using paid or free software . The Internal Revenue Service provides a Free File program   a public - private partnership that allows people with adjusted gross incomes of less than $ 64   000 to file their taxes using free software . Roughly 70 percent of American taxpayers are eligible for this free software   according to the Free File Alliance   which partners with the IRS for this program . In tax year 2016   the program made a new push to offer more software options that are free for taxpayers . “ A married couple won ’ t pay a dime in taxes on their first $ 24   000 of income . So a married couple   up to $ 24   000   can spend their money on their family   on their children   on what they have to do — so much better .” It ’ s debatable that this would be much better for a middle - class couple with children — and it could be worse . The tax plan would nearly double the standard deduction   $ 12   000 for individuals and $ 24   000 for married couples   but also eliminate personal and dependent exemptions ( currently $ 4   050 per family member ). So a couple with two children already “ don ’ t pay a dime ” on their first $ 28   800 . That ’ s because they get $ 12   600 in a standard deduction and $ 16   200 in dependent and personal exemptions . It ’ s possible Trump ’ s expanded child tax credit might help make up some of the difference   but maybe not . Lily Batchelder   a professor of public policy at New York University who was deputy director of the National Economic Council in 2014 - 2015   “ conservatively ” estimated in 2016 that “ Trump ’ s plan would increase taxes for about 8 . 7 million families  ” but the number could be as high as 11 million under “ reasonable assumptions .” That analysis was based on Trump ’ s campaign plan   which envisioned a larger increase in the standard deduction ($ 30   000 for a married couple ). “ The tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s when our economy took off   the middle class thrived . And the family income of all families was increasing more and more   and it was a beautiful sight to behold .” This is a flip - flop . He was always a fierce critic of the bill   Reagan ’ s Tax Reform Act of 1986   which he now calls “ a beautiful sight to behold .” The law simplified tax brackets and eliminated tax shelters   and also lowered the top individual tax rate to 28 percent but raised the capital gains rate to the same level   giving them parity . In the years following the law    Trump  repeatedly blamed  it  for the savings and loan crisis   a decline in real estate investing and the 1990 - 1991 recession . “ This tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for  the country    for the real estate industry   and I really hope that something can be done  ”  Trump  told Congress in 1991 . In a television interview with Joan Rivers    he  said : “ What caused the savings and loan crisis was the 1986 tax law change . It took all of the incentives away from investors .”  Trump  also frequently attacked one of the Democratic sponsors of the bill   Sen . Bill Bradley ( D - N . J .)  including in a Wall Street Journal commentary in 1999 . Bradley ’ s last big idea to be enacted into legislation was also one of the worst ideas in recent history  ”  Trump  wrote   saying Bradley was responsible for the elimination of a tax shelter for real estate investments . (  He  said the good parts of the bill could be attributed to Reagan .) “ Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens . … All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision … [ which ] included electing a governor who you may have heard of   who signed the largest income tax cut in the state ’ s history   our very   very terrific person and terrific vice president   Mike Pence .” This lacks context . As governor   Vice President Pence did make the largest income tax cut in Indiana ’ s history — but he didn ’ t have a very high bar to overcome   and it was a modest cut . Prior to Pence   there was only one time the income tax was cut without an offsetting increase   in the 1970s . Moreover   Indiana ’ s individual income - tax rate was already the second - lowest in the nation when Pence took office . Indiana ’ s individual income tax rate was 2 percent when it was established in 1964   then it was cut by 0 . 1 percent in 1979 . It rose to 3 percent in 1984   in response to revenue losses from the 1979 - 1982 recession   according to Purdue University economist Larry DeBoer . Then the rate increased to 3 . 4 percent in 1988   and remained that way until Pence cut it by 0 . 2 percentage points   to 3 . 2 percent . As governor   Pence established a record of cutting taxes . But according to the Indianapolis Star   state lawmakers raised taxes as soon as Pence left office . And compared to overall tax cuts in Indiana   Pence ’ s income tax cut is far from the largest tax cut in state history . “ I ’ m doing the right thing and it ’ s not good for me   believe me . … We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax   or AMT .” Trump ’ s claim that he would not benefit from the tax plan is not credible . Of course   he has not released his tax returns   so it is difficult to know for sure . But he is certainly subject to the AMT — and the one recent tax return that has been leaked   from 2005   shows that the AMT increased his tax bill from about $ 5 . 3 million to $ 36 . 5 million . So at least in that tax year   he potentially could have saved $ 31 million . Eliminating the estate tax   meanwhile   is likely to benefit his heirs .

We fact checked his address . ( Meg Kelly / The Washington Post ) President Trump ’ s speech on the administration ’ s still - somewhat - vague tax plan   delivered in Indianapolis on Sept . 27   was filled with many of his favorite   inaccurate claims . For instance   he repeatedly says he is offering the “ largest tax cut in our country ’ s history  ” a dubious claim when properly measured as a percentage of the nation ’ s gross domestic product . Here ’ s a sampling of other inaccurate claims — and one case in which he appears to have adjusted his language because of our previous fact checks . “ To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer   we are finally ending the crushing   the horrible   the unfair estate tax   or as it is often referred to   the death tax .” The president ’ s suggestion that “ millions ” of small businesses and farms are affected by the estate tax is absurd . According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center   only about 5   500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million estates — would have to pay any taxes . About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent . That ’ s because for a married couple   about $ 11 million is exempt from taxation . Only 80 — that ’ s right   80 — taxable estates would be farms and small businesses . That ’ s a big change from the past . In 1977   139   000 estates had to pay the tax . In 2000   it was 52   000 . But Congress has kept raising the exemption and lowering the tax rate . So for virtually all Americans   even farms and small businesses   the estate tax is just not a problem . “ Today   our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world .”  Trump  exaggerates here . The United States certainly has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world   currently pegged as high as 39 . 1 percent when including state taxes . ( The federal rate is 35 percent .)  Trump  says  it  is 60 percent higher than “ our average competitor in the developed world  ” comparing 39 . 1 percent to the average rate for the other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   which is 25 . 5 percent when not weighted for GDP . ( It is 31 . 4 percent when weighted for GDP .) But the official rate does not necessarily tell the whole story . What also matters is the actual tax a company pays   after deductions and tax benefits . That is known as the effective tax rate   which can be calculated differently depending on the survey . According to the Congressional Research Service   the effective rate for the United States is 27 . 1 percent   compared with an effective GDP - weighted average of 27 . 7 percent for the OECD . “ Although the U . S . statutory tax rate is higher   the average effective rate is about the same   and the marginal rate on new investment is only slightly higher  ” the CRS says . The Congressional Budget Office   when it examined the issue   said the U . S . effective tax rate was 18 . 6 percent   which it said was among the highest of the biggest economic powers   the Group of 20 . “ Americans waste so much money   billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code . More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes .” Kudos to Trump for updating a formerly misleading phrase that “ more than 90 percent of Americans need professional help to do their own taxes .” This 90 percent figure refers to people who file taxes by hiring professionals or using tax software   such as Turbo Tax   which helps people file their taxes on their own . According to the National Taxpayer Advocate ’ s 2016 report   54 percent of individual taxpayers pay preparers and about 40 percent of individual taxpayers use software that costs about $ 50 or more . Still   it ’ s worth pointing out that there are more options now for people to easily file their taxes   using paid or free software . The Internal Revenue Service provides a Free File program   a public - private partnership that allows people with adjusted gross incomes of less than $ 64   000 to file their taxes using free software . Roughly 70 percent of American taxpayers are eligible for this free software   according to the Free File Alliance   which partners with the IRS for this program . In tax year 2016   the program made a new push to offer more software options that are free for taxpayers . “ A married couple won ’ t pay a dime in taxes on their first $ 24   000 of income . So a married couple   up to $ 24   000   can spend their money on their family   on their children   on what they have to do — so much better .” It ’ s debatable that this would be much better for a middle - class couple with children — and it could be worse . The tax plan would nearly double the standard deduction   $ 12   000 for individuals and $ 24   000 for married couples   but also eliminate personal and dependent exemptions ( currently $ 4   050 per family member ). So a couple with two children already “ don ’ t pay a dime ” on their first $ 28   800 . That ’ s because they get $ 12   600 in a standard deduction and $ 16   200 in dependent and personal exemptions . It ’ s possible Trump ’ s expanded child tax credit might help make up some of the difference   but maybe not . Lily Batchelder   a professor of public policy at New York University who was deputy director of the National Economic Council in 2014 - 2015   “ conservatively ” estimated in 2016 that “ Trump ’ s plan would increase taxes for about 8 . 7 million families  ” but the number could be as high as 11 million under “ reasonable assumptions .” That analysis was based on Trump ’ s campaign plan   which envisioned a larger increase in the standard deduction ($ 30   000 for a married couple ). “ The tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s when our economy took off   the middle class thrived . And the family income of all families was increasing more and more   and it was a beautiful sight to behold .” This is a flip - flop . He was always a fierce critic of the bill   Reagan ’ s Tax Reform Act of 1986   which he now calls “ a beautiful sight to behold .” The law simplified tax brackets and eliminated tax shelters   and also lowered the top individual tax rate to 28 percent but raised the capital gains rate to the same level   giving them parity . In the years following the law    Trump  repeatedly blamed  it  for the savings and loan crisis   a decline in real estate investing and the 1990 - 1991 recession . “ This tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for  the country    for the real estate industry   and I really hope that something can be done  ”  Trump  told Congress in 1991 . In a television interview with Joan Rivers    he  said : “ What caused the savings and loan crisis was the 1986 tax law change . It took all of the incentives away from investors .”  Trump  also frequently attacked one of the Democratic sponsors of the bill   Sen . Bill Bradley ( D - N . J .)  including in a Wall Street Journal commentary in 1999 . Bradley ’ s last big idea to be enacted into legislation was also one of the worst ideas in recent history  ”  Trump  wrote   saying Bradley was responsible for the elimination of a tax shelter for real estate investments . (  He  said the good parts of the bill could be attributed to Reagan .) “ Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens . … All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision … [ which ] included electing a governor who you may have heard of   who signed the largest income tax cut in the state ’ s history   our very   very terrific person and terrific vice president   Mike Pence .” This lacks context . As governor   Vice President Pence did make the largest income tax cut in Indiana ’ s history — but he didn ’ t have a very high bar to overcome   and it was a modest cut . Prior to Pence   there was only one time the income tax was cut without an offsetting increase   in the 1970s . Moreover   Indiana ’ s individual income - tax rate was already the second - lowest in the nation when Pence took office . Indiana ’ s individual income tax rate was 2 percent when it was established in 1964   then it was cut by 0 . 1 percent in 1979 . It rose to 3 percent in 1984   in response to revenue losses from the 1979 - 1982 recession   according to Purdue University economist Larry DeBoer . Then the rate increased to 3 . 4 percent in 1988   and remained that way until Pence cut it by 0 . 2 percentage points   to 3 . 2 percent . As governor   Pence established a record of cutting taxes . But according to the Indianapolis Star   state lawmakers raised taxes as soon as Pence left office . And compared to overall tax cuts in Indiana   Pence ’ s income tax cut is far from the largest tax cut in state history . “ I ’ m doing the right thing and it ’ s not good for me   believe me . … We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax   or AMT .” Trump ’ s claim that he would not benefit from the tax plan is not credible . Of course   he has not released his tax returns   so it is difficult to know for sure . But he is certainly subject to the AMT — and the one recent tax return that has been leaked   from 2005   shows that the AMT increased his tax bill from about $ 5 . 3 million to $ 36 . 5 million . So at least in that tax year   he potentially could have saved $ 31 million . Eliminating the estate tax   meanwhile   is likely to benefit his heirs .

4565,One Million Trees Pledged to 'Trump Forest' to Offset President's Anti,Donald Trump,"The idea behind the effort is simple. "" US President Donald Trump  doesn't believe in the science of human-caused climate change.  He  wants to ignore one of the greatest threats to healthy life on Earth "" the project website states.
"" Trump  wants to bring back coal despite scientists telling us we cannot afford to burn it  and despite economists telling us there's more money to be made and more jobs available in renewable energy "" the statement continues. ""So we're planting a forest to soak up the extra greenhouse gases  Trump  plans to put into our atmosphere. We're planting a global forest to offset  Trump 's monumental stupidity.""
The forest does not have a single  physical location. Rather  anyone who wants to participate in the project can plant trees anywhere around the world in  Trump 's name. Once that's done  you send the group a receipt so the contribution is added to the global Trump Forest map.

We really look forward to making Earth great again.""","The idea behind the effort is simple. "" [TGT]doesn't believe in the science of human-caused climate change.  [TGT]  wants to ignore one of the greatest threats to healthy life on Earth "" the project website states.
"" [TGT]wants to bring back coal despite scientists telling us we cannot afford to burn [TGT]  and despite economists telling us there's more money to be made and more jobs available in renewable energy "" the statement continues. ""So we're planting a forest to soak up the extra greenhouse gases  [TGT]  plans to put into our atmosphere. We're planting a global forest to offset  Trump 's monumental stupidity.""
The forest does not have a single  physical location. Rather  anyone who wants to participate in the project can plant trees anywhere around the world in  Trump 's name.

4566,Swiss mountain town Davos relishing in Trump spotlight,Donald Trump,"DAVOS  Switzerland (Reuters) - The Swiss Alpine town of Davos is used to celebrities and high-rollers  but even it is relishing new attention being heaped on it with  U.S. President Donald Trump’s  decision to attend the World Economic Forum this month
 Trump’s  visit to Davos for the annual meet-up of global political and business leaders will be the first for a sitting U.S. president since Bill Clinton came in 2000.
 Trump ’s policies  including  his  intention to exit the 2015 Paris climate accord and  his  “America First” tendencies  may not sit well with all of Switzerland  which backs the global climate pact and whose economy relies on global trade.
This has prompted some critics to suggest  Trump ’s polarising persona could resurrect violent anti-WEF protests from the early 2000s. An online petition is circulating telling  Trump  he is not welcome.
Still  the tenor in Davos this week Thursday was upbeat  with many confident a robust security contingent -- up to 5 000 soldiers if necessary alongside about 1 000 police -- can handle any furor surrounding  Trump ’s presence.

4567,As Trump attacks U.S. law enforcement another top official quits,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department’s third-ranking official  Rachel Brand  plans to step down and take a senior job at Walmart Inc(WMT.N)  sources familiar with her decision said on Friday  at a time when  President Donald Trump  has taken aim at senior law enforcement officials.
Brand was next in line of succession to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into potential collusion between  Trump ’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and whether  the Republican president  has unlawfully sought to obstruct the ongoing probe.
After just nine months on the job  Brand had grown increasingly uncomfortable with  Trump ’s escalating attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI  which  she  and other law enforcement professionals feared was beginning to undermine the rule of law  according to sources familiar with  her  thinking.
The attacks have escalated in recent weeks as Republicans in Congress have criticized the handling by the Justice Department  FBI and the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court of warrants for surveillance of a  Trump  campaign advisor  Carter Page  who had ties to Russia.  Trump  called the matter “a disgrace.”
News of Brand’s departure comes a week after  Trump  approved the release of a previously classified memo written by Republican lawmakers that portrayed the Russia investigation  initially handled by the FBI and now headed by Mueller  as a product of political bias against  Trump  at the FBI and Justice Department.
 Trump  also has criticized Sessions for recusing  himself .
On Feb. 2  just hours before  Trump  approved the release of the Republican memo  Sessions offered praise for Rosenstein  the department’s No. 2 official  and Brand  saying they “represent the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.”
 Trump  fired then-FBI Director James Comey  who was leading the agency’s Russia investigation  in May 2017  saying  he  took the action because of “this Russia thing.”
The FBI’s deputy director  Andrew McCabe  stepped down in January after  Trump  repeatedly criticized him on Twitter. McCabe’s wife previously ran as a Democrat for a seat in Virginia’s state Senate and received donations from then-Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe  a close ally of Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department’s third-ranking official  Rachel Brand  plans to step down and take a senior job at Walmart Inc(WMT.N)  sources familiar with her decision said on Friday  at a time when  [TGT]has taken aim at senior law enforcement officials.

 Trump  is primed to make calls on several matters critical to international commerce  including whether to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement  whether to slap tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel  and how to approach a brewing conflict over trade with China.

4570,Trump sees 'miracle' Puerto Rico survival ignores critics,Donald Trump,"SAN JUAN  Puerto Rico (AP) — Touring a small slice of Hurricane Maria's devastation   President Donald Trump  congratulated Puerto Rico on Tuesday for escaping the higher death toll of ""a real catastrophe like Katrina"" and heaped praise on the relief efforts of  his  administration without mentioning the sharp criticism the federal response has drawn.
""Really nothing short of a miracle ""  he  said of the recovery  an assessment at odds with the despair of many still struggling to find water and food outside the capital city in wide swaths of an island where only 5 percent of electricity customers have power back. The governor of Puerto Rico said late Tuesday that the official death toll has been increased to 34 from 16.
In the heart of San Juan  in fact  a few miles from the air base where  Trump  gave  his  thumbs-up report on progress  people stacked sewage-fouled clothes and mattresses outside houses and businesses lacking electricity nearly two weeks after the storm. ""Nobody's come "" said Ray Negron  38  collecting debris in the Playita neighborhood.
 Trump  pledged an all-out effort to help the island while adding  somewhat lightly: ""Now I hate to tell you  Puerto Rico  but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that's fine. We've saved a lot of lives.""
 Trump  said  his  visit was ""not about me"" but then praised local officials for offering kind words about  his  administration's recovery effort and invited one to repeat the ""nice things""  she 'd said earlier.  Trump  also singled out Gov. Ricardo Rossello for ""giving us the highest praise.""
""Every death is a horror ""  he  said  ""but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous  hundreds of and hundreds and hundreds of people that died  and you look at what happened here with  really  a storm that was just totally overpowering  nobody has ever seen anything like this.""  He  told local officials ""you can be very proud of all your people  all of our people working together.""
Air Force One brought  the president  first lady Melania Trump and aides to Puerto Rico  for a tour stretching through the afternoon. At least parts of the itinerary seemed drawn to ensure a friendly reception:  Trump  visited with selected families waiting on  their  laws on a street lined with debris  including tree limbs and corrugated metal siding.  Trump  posed for photos  asked the residents what it was like during the storm and pledged  his  assistance.

Up the road in the upscale Guaynabo neighborhood  one of the fastest to recover  around 200 people cheered  Trump 's visit to a local church being used to distribute supplies. Many crowded around  him  for cellphone photos as  he  handed out flashlights and tossed rolls of paper towels into the friendly crowd.
""There's a lot of love in this room  a lot of love ""  Trump  said. ""Great people.""
Asked by the AP what  he  has to say to people still without power  food and water   he  spoke of the generators brought to the island and said the electrical grid is being fixed.
""Again  the job that's been done here is really nothing short of a miracle ""  he  said.
For much of  his  tour   Trump  remained focused primarily on drawing praise.
""I appreciate your support and I know you appreciate ours ""  Trump  said. ""Our country has really gone all out. It's not only dangerous  it's expensive. But I consider it a great honor.""

4571,Trump  the master manipulator using anthem controversy to divide Americans,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump knows better than anyone that the debate over kneeling during the national anthem has everything to do with race. That's exactly why  he  entered the fray.
 Trump  is a master manipulator of America's raw emotions.  He  enjoys grinding the knife deep into the hearts of the victimized until they scream out in pain. Then  he  stands back and gloats as the country chooses sides and rips itself apart.
In  his  speech in Alabama last week  Trump mixed a volatile cocktail of patriotism  heritage and race. It was no accident that  he  picked this fight over American values in a state with a shameful history of segregation  discrimination and racial tensions.
""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners  when somebody disrespects our flag  to say  'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. He is fired. He's fired '""  Trump  told the assembly of mostly white supporters to loud applause.
Without calling names   Trump  was clearly talking about African-American athletes who chose to take a knee in protest over police brutality and other racial inequities rather than stand for the national anthem during NFL games.
 He  intended for blacks to take  his  comments personally. And they did.
In the same speech  laced with references to the Second Amendment and  his  proposed Mexican border wall  Trump made another statement that was just as divisive.
The way  Trump  sees it  African-Americans and other minorities are messing everything up for white Americans. Now  they want to ruin football.
In  Trump 's view  blacks make it harder for law enforcement when they complain about police brutality. The country would be much better off  in his opinion  if ""those people"" (the term he used in his speech) just went somewhere and shut up.
Black athletes often become a part of America's elite once they hit it big. African-Americans and whites embrace them for their prowess on the football field or basketball court. America turns them into heroes  role models and examples of success.  Trump  seems to think these athletes should be grateful for the respect they are given.
 Trump  also seems to imply that athletes should be grateful to NFL owners for giving them a chance to make something of themselves. It is the kind of mentality that masters held regarding blacks on their plantations — a method that was used to keep slaves subservient.
 Trump  chooses to ignore the fact that if  it  were not for these black athletes  there would be no NFL or NBA. Franchise owners  however  know the real deal. That's why they are locking arms with their players.","[TGT] knows better than anyone that the debate over kneeling during the national anthem has everything to do with race.

""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners  when somebody disrespects our flag  to say  'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. He is fired. He's fired '""  Trump  told the assembly of mostly white supporters to loud applause.
Without calling names   Trump  was clearly talking about African-American athletes who chose to take a knee in protest over police brutality and other racial inequities rather than stand for the national anthem during NFL games.
 He  intended for blacks to take  his  comments personally. And they did.
In the same speech  laced with references to the Second Amendment and  his  proposed Mexican border wall  Trump made another statement that was just as divisive.
The way  Trump  sees it  African-Americans and other minorities are messing everything up for white Americans. Now  they want to ruin football.
In  Trump 's view  blacks make it harder for law enforcement when they complain about police brutality. The country would be much better off  in his opinion  if ""those people"" (the term he used in his speech) just went somewhere and shut up.
Black athletes often become a part of America's elite once they hit it big. African-Americans and whites embrace them for their prowess on the football field or basketball court. America turns them into heroes  role models and examples of success.  Trump  seems to think these athletes should be grateful for the respect they are given.
 Trump  also seems to imply that athletes should be grateful to NFL owners for giving them a chance to make something of themselves. It is the kind of mentality that masters held regarding blacks on their plantations — a method that was used to keep slaves subservient.
 Trump  chooses to ignore the fact that if  it  were not for these black athletes  there would be no NFL or NBA. Franchise owners  however  know the real deal. That's why they are locking arms with their players.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,,,,
4572,Trump pushes hardline immigration policies even as he urges unity,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  urged lawmakers on Tuesday to work toward bipartisan compromises  but pushed a hard line on immigration  insisting on a border wall and other concessions from Democrats as part of any deal to protect the children of illegal immigrants.
 Trump   in  his  first State of the Union speech  gave no ground on the contentious issue of whether to shield young immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation.
Aiming to keep conservative supporters happy as  he  looks to November congressional elections   Trump  stood by a set of principles opposed by Democrats  including the border wall with Mexico and new restrictions on how many family members that legal immigrants can bring into the United States.
“Tonight  I call upon all of us to set aside our differences  to seek out common ground  and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve ”  Trump  said in  his  address.
 Trump  used the hour-and-20-minute speech  given annually by presidents to Congress  to try to overcome doubts about  his  presidency at a time when  he  is battling a probe into  his  campaign’s alleged ties with Russia and suffering low job approval ratings.
 Trump  made no mention of the federal probe into whether  his  campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 presidential election  a controversy that is dogging  his  presidency.  Trump  has denied collusion and has called the probe a “witch hunt.”
The speech was short on details about  Trump ’s policy proposals.
But  his  sober  measured approach was welcomed by the public. A CNN/SSRS snap poll said 48 percent of those surveyed had a “very positive” response to the speech and 22 percent “somewhat positive.”
There was little sign of unity inside the House of Representatives chamber where  Trump  spoke. Republican lawmakers cheered wildly at the president’s applause lines. Democrats often sat in their seats silently and many booed when he laid out his immigration proposals.
Turning to foreign policy late in the speech   Trump  denounced the “depraved character” of North Korea’s leadership and said Pyongyang’s “reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.”
“We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening ”  he  said. In a surprise moment   he  singled out a North Korea defector in the crowd  Ji Seong-ho  as an example of  what he called the reclusive country’s brutal nature .
 Trump  also said  he  had signed an order to keep open the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  for foreign terrorism suspects. Former Democratic President Barack Obama had vowed to close the prison  which has been condemned by human rights groups  but was unable to shut it down completely.
Whether  Trump  would follow through on  his  appeal for bipartisan harmony was far from clear.  Trump’s  past attempts at a unifying message have been undermined by  his  later rancorous tweets and divisive statements that angered Democrats and frequently annoyed lawmakers in  his  own Republican Party.

4575,Trump pushes for tighter gun rules backed by NRA after Florida shooting,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  who ran as a gun-rights advocate   has started to publicly discuss tighter restrictions on firearms following the massacre of 17 people at a Florida high school.
So far  he  has proceeded carefully  balancing a desire to take action with a desire to keep  his  political base happy. This week   the president  has pushed mostly for modest steps already backed by the National Rifle Association — which is a powerful influence among gun owners in many of the areas that propelled  Trump  to the presidency.
While  Trump 's support gives Republicans in Congress more cover to pass narrow gun control measures  it is unclear what action lawmakers will take following the latest in a string of mass shootings  including last week's rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida. Pressure has increased this week amid widely followed protests and calls for action from students at the school.
 Trump  may provide more detail on  his  gun control stance on Wednesday afternoon.  The president  is scheduled to host a listening session with students  teachers and parents involved in the Florida shooting as well as the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut and the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado.
On Tuesday   Trump  signed a memorandum recommending that Attorney General Jeff Sessions propose rules banning so-called bump stocks  which can effectively turn semi-automatic weapons into machine guns. The gunman who massacred more than 50 people at a concert in Las Vegas last year used such a device.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also told reporters  Trump  is open to supporting a bipartisan Senate bill to close holes in the current background check system.  It  aims to make federal agencies better at following rules that require them to submit criminal convictions to the FBI  which could help stop high-risk individuals from getting guns.","[TGT]has started to publicly discuss tighter restrictions on firearms following the massacre of 17 people at a Florida high school.

4579,In wake of Florida school shooting tearful student asks Trump : 'How do we not stop this?',Donald Trump,"Spilling out wrenching tales of lost lives and stolen security  students and parents appealed to  President Donald Trump  to set politics aside and protect America's schoolchildren from the scourge of gun violence.  Trump  listened intently to the raw emotion and pledged action  including the possibility of arming teachers.
 Trump  promised to be ""very strong on background checks."" And  he  suggested  he  supported allowing some teachers and other school employees to carry concealed weapons to be ready for intruders. But largely  he  listened Wednesday  holding handwritten notes bearing  his  message to the families. ""I hear you"" was written in black marker.

 The president  had invited the teen survivors of school violence and parents of murdered children in a show of  his  resolve against gun violence in the wake of last week's shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  and in past years at schools in Connecticut and Colorado. The latest episode has prompted a renewed and growing call for stronger gun control.
 Trump  asked  his  guests to suggest solutions and solicited feedback.  He  did not fully endorse any specific policy solution  but pledged to take action and expressed interest in widely differing approaches.
Besides considering concealed carrying of weapons by trained school employees  a concept  he  has endorsed in the past   he  said  he  planned to go ""very strongly into age  age of purchase."" And  he  said  he  was committed to improving background checks and working on mental health.
A strong supporter of gun rights   Trump  has nonetheless indicated in recent days that  he  is willing to consider ideas not in keeping with National Rifle Association orthodoxy  including age restrictions for buying assault-type weapons. Still  gun owners are a key part of  his  base of supporters.
The student body president at the Parkland school  Julia Cordover  tearfully told  Trump  that she ""was lucky enough to come home from school.""
 Trump  later tweeted that  he  would ""always remember"" the meeting. ""So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!""
""His point was ( Trump  needs) to come to Parkland  we're not going there "" she said.
Throughout the day Wednesday  television news showed footage of student survivors of the violence marching on the Florida state Capitol  calling for tougher laws.

 Trump  embraced gun rights during  his  presidential campaign  though  he  supported some gun control before  he  became a candidate  backing an assault weapons ban and a longer waiting period to purchase a gun in a 2000 book.

 [TGT]had invited the teen survivors of school violence and parents of murdered children in a show of  [TGT]  resolve against gun violence in the wake of last week's shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  and in past years at schools in Connecticut and Colorado. The latest episode has prompted a renewed and growing call for stronger gun control.
 [TGT]asked  [TGT]  guests to suggest solutions and solicited feedback.  [TGT]  did not fully endorse any specific policy solution  but pledged to take action and expressed interest in widely differing approaches.
Besides considering concealed carrying of weapons by trained school employees  a concept  [TGT]  has endorsed in the past   [TGT]  said  [TGT]  planned to go ""very strongly into age  age of purchase."" And  he  said  he  was committed to improving background checks and working on mental health.
A strong supporter of gun rights   [TGT]has nonetheless indicated in recent days that  he  is willing to consider ideas not in keeping with National Rifle Association orthodoxy  including age restrictions for buying assault-type weapons. Still  gun owners are a key part of  his  base of supporters.
The student body president at the Parkland school  Julia Cordover  tearfully told  [TGT]that she ""was lucky enough to come home from school.""
 Trump  later tweeted that  he  would ""always remember"" the meeting. ""So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down. We must keep our children safe!!""
""His point was ( [TGT]needs) to come to Parkland  we're not going there "" she said.
Throughout the day Wednesday  television news showed footage of student survivors of the violence marching on the Florida state Capitol  calling for tougher laws.

4580,Trump Greeted Enthusiastically In Lake Charles Louisiana During Pit Stop,Donald Trump,"LAKE CHARLES  Louisiana — Hundreds of enthusiastic Louisianans waving American flags  Texas Lives Matter signs  and 2016 campaign lawn signs greeted  President Donald Trump  during  his  brief stop at the National Guard headquarters here Saturday.
 Trump’s  15 minute stop  during which  he  met members of the Cajun Navy rescue group  is the last stop on  his  tour of areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. Although Lake Charles didn’t receive the brunt of Hurricane Harvey’s destruction  it has been a staging point for relief efforts in eastern Texas. And while there wasn’t much in the way of disaster touring to be done in Lake Charles  the pit stop is sure to lift the spirits of a president with historic unpopularity.
Lake Charles is friendly territory for Trump  who waved and smiled at the crowd outside the headquarters. “I think it’s great. It’s a chance to see how much everybody here in Louisiana supports him ” said Kim Strickell  a Lake Charles native who came to catch a glimpse of the president along with her family and friends. Strickell said she is pleased with how Trump has handled the aftermath of Harvey. “He’s put federal dollars out there ahead of it. That’s a big help ” Strickell said. Her nephew  16-year-old Jack Slade  was also on hand. An ardent supporter of Trump  Slade said “even though I am a minor  I know my beliefs already.” Although the crowd was almost entirely made up of  Trump  supporters  there were also plenty of people simply on hand to witness a bit of history. “It’s historic ” said Miles Brown  23. Asked if he was a  Trump  supporter  Brown hesitated. “I’m not going to say that exactly. But I hope for the best with this president. Because I’m tired of seeing the same thing going on. This person did say he wanted change. I haven’t seen it yet  but it’s better to support him than keep talking down on him.”
There is. group of  Trump  supporters awaiting his arrival & this one not a fan of @cnn but @buzzfeed he ❤️
But at least one family wasn’t pleased with  Trump ’s visit. The fence of a house across the street had an “#IMPEACH” sign painted in huge white letters across it  and the owners sat on the roof holding protest signs as  Trump ’s motorcade rolled by. Earlier in the day  one of the owners of the house across the street from the headquarters  who identified herself as “Ms. King. Because I have to do business in this town ” had painted an “#IMPEACH” sign painted in huge white letters across her fence. At one point  two men attempted to cover the sign with a tarp  but her husband stopped them  warning “you best get away from my fence.” For King  Trump’s visit had nothing to do with Harvey — and everything to do with his already started 2020 reelection campaign. “Something happened here. It’s called a disaster. But that’s not what all this is about ” she said waving dismissively at the president’s motorcade from her perched on top of her roof. “It’s all about the campaign for 2020.”","LAKE CHARLES  Louisiana — Hundreds of enthusiastic Louisianans waving American flags  Texas Lives Matter signs  and 2016 campaign lawn signs greeted  [TGT]during  [TGT]  brief stop at the National Guard headquarters here Saturday.

4582,Eminem unleashed the primal scream lots of Americans feel about Trump,Donald Trump,"(CNN) On Tuesday night at the annual BET awards  Eminem unleashed a verbal tirade against  President Donald Trump  the likes of which we haven't seen in the two-plus years since the real-estate mogul emerged on the political scene.
""All these horrible tragedies and  he 's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm "" the rapper  whose given name is Marshall Mathers  said at one point. He labeled  Trump  ""'a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust"" at another.
What Eminem captures in those moments are emotions that lots and lots of people -- Democrats  yes  but also plenty of other people too -- are experiencing in the age of  Trump . How did this happen? What does it say about our country that we we elected  Trump ? What does it say about us? And  again  how could this happen?
Back in February  a Pew poll asked people how  Trump  made them feel. About 4 in 10 said ""angry"" -- a number that inlcuded two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. A majority of people (52%) said that  Trump  made them feel ""uneasy "" including 80% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. And that was in February -- long before  Trump 's botched handling of Charlottesville  Virginia  or  his  ongoing attacks on NFL players.
(To be clear: There are plenty of people who are thrilled with how  Trump  has handled the presidency to date and who see Eminem and the rest of the ""coastal elites"" as deeply out of touch with the average person.)
At the same time  what Eminem is channeling in this latest freestyle is very real. This line in particular: ""He cannot withstand the fact that we are not afraid of  Trump . Walking on eggshells? I came to stomp.""

Dems huge House haul worries GOP - Politico: “Is it time for Republicans to start freaking out? More than 40 House Republican incumbents were outraised in the final quarter of 2017 by one — or several — of their Democratic opponents  according to the latest round of fundraising numbers. And of that group  more than a dozen had less cash on hand than their Democratic challengers. For the GOP  here’s the really disturbing part: The trendline is getting worse  not better. Despite the myriad advantages of incumbency and control of Congress  there are more House members with less cash on hand than their Democratic challengers than the quarter before. … A flood of Democratic money poured into House races across the country in 2017  provided in large part by small-dollar  online contributors animated by opposition to President Donald Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress.”
WSJ: “Congress is expected this week to pass yet another short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown  prompting a bipartisan pair of senators to introduce a narrow bill on immigration aimed at ending the impasse that has hindered a two-year budget deal. The government’s current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Friday. Immigration has become entangled in the spending negotiations since  President Donald Trump  last year ended an Obama-era program that protects young people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children  known as Dreamers. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R.  Ariz.) and Sen. Chris Coons (D.  Del.) plan to unveil a proposal that offers a path to citizenship for Dreamers and orders a comprehensive study to determine what border-security measures are needed. But the bill stops well short of almost all of the president’s demands—including immediate funding for the wall along the southern border—and is likely to meet a chilly reception from conservative Republicans.”
Congress weighs one year extension for DREAMers - Politico: “Congress may just end up punting on its Dreamer dilemma. As lawmakers grasp for a solution for the young undocumented immigrants  one option is a temporary extension — perhaps one year — of their legal protections paired with a little bit of cash for border security. ‘That may be where we’re headed because  you know  Congress is pretty dysfunctional ’ said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)  one of the few to publicly acknowledge the possibility of a temporary fix. ‘That’d be a real loss. But that’s probably where we’re headed  OK?’ Some senators are already deriding a yearlong patch as ‘misguided ’ a ‘Plan Z’ and a proposal that would keep immigrants ‘in fear.’ But lawmakers have only until March 5 to save the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program under  President Donald Trump’s  deadline.”
New push for Medicaid limits draws heavily on Clinton-era model - Atlantic: “Welfare reform is back.  President Trump  signaled  its  return to the forefront of national policy debates in  his  State of the Union address on Tuesday  when  he  announced a plan to  ‘ lift our citizens from welfare to work.’  He  shouldn’t have trouble finding support for it: With a collective of pro-reform officials leading key agencies  and with longtime entitlement crusader Paul Ryan as speaker of the House  the GOP in 2018 will have its best chance in a generation to make major changes to the country’s safety-net programs  including Medicaid and food stamps. As a template  Republicans will use the original welfare-reform bill: the 1996 law that created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  or TANF  program  which changed the financing and benefit structure of cash assistance. For conservatives  the program has been a model of resounding success  with shrinking costs and a welfare caseload that decreases by the year.”
Politico: “Republican leaders are acknowledging that the FBI disclosed the political origins of a private dossier the bureau cited in an application to surveil former  Trump  campaign adviser Carter Page  undermining a controversial GOP memo released Friday and fueling Democratic demands to declassify more information about the bureau’s actions. At issue is whether the federal probe into the  Trump  campaign’s Russia ties is infected with political bias  as Republicans say — or whether the GOP is using deceitful tactics to quash the probe  as Democrats insist. Democrats pounced on public comments over the past day by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and intelligence committee member Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.)  arguing that the GOP memo’s failure to mention a key footnote in the FBI application shows how the party has cherry-picked classified facts to protect  President Donald Trump .

 Trump  opened by praising the beauty and weather of Puerto Rico  with the exception of the whole hurricane thing. ""Your weather is second to none but once in a while you get hit ""  he  said. ""And you really got hit  there's no question about it."" Maybe it was the jovial tone or maybe it was the small smile on  his  face but this one was ... yeah.
"" He  didn't play politics.""
We already know  Trump  spent a lot of time and energy attacking San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz  who begged FEMA and members of the administration for more help in the aftermath of the storm  but didn't mention  Trump  by name.
And that's certainly who  he  was implicitly criticizing when  he  heaped praise on Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello by insisting  ""this governor did not play politics   he  didn't play it all ...  he  was giving us the highest grades.""

Shade by omission! By the way  Mayor Cruz was in attendance — the briefing was in San Juan  after all — and yet  despite praising other officials and government agencies   Trump  had no praise for the mayor.
As  Trump  introduced  his  budget chief Mick Mulvaney   Trump  jokingly chided Puerto Rico for the hit  his  budget took because they had the gall to get hit by a major hurricane.
So  right after he made the budget crack   Trump  then made an awkward transition to discussing the death toll and how happy he was it wasn't higher. In fact  Puerto Rico hasn't updated the current toll — 16 — in nearly a week and suspicions are growing that the actual toll will be much higher.
Not higher than Katrina  no  likely not  just as  Trump  pointed out. But then by comparing Maria to Katrina   Trump  implied that Katrina was ""a real catastrophe "" which means Maria ... wasn't?
Just heard  Trump  say Puerto Rico should be very proud only 16 people died against the 1000s in Katrina.
Talking to an Air Force representative  who  Trump  seemed to at first mistake for a Coast Guard officer   Trump  brought up one of  his  favorite topics  the F-35 fighter jet.
Why  though?!? The press conference was ostensibly about a hurricane and the federal government's response to it  not an opportunity to brag about the cost of an unrelated aircraft (which  Trump  may not even deserve credit for).
""Its' hard to fight a plane you can't see ""  Trump  said. ""But that's an expensive plane you can't see. And as you probably heard  we cut the price quite substantially. Something that other administrations never have done  that I can tell you.""

4586,From Roy Moore to NFL protests a look back at a year in identity politics,Donald Trump,"During his presidential campaign   Trump  asserted that  he  would make a better president for the LGBT community than Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. But after  he  was elected   Trump  failed to recognize LGBT Pride Month in June  which commemorates the birth of the modern gay rights movement.  He  also proposed that transgender people be banned from serving in the military  allegedly joked that Vice President Pence wanted to harm LGBT people and endorsed a Republican Senate candidate who said that homosexuality should be illegal.

A Harvard Institute of Politics poll found that 67 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds are more fearful than hopeful about the country’s future.

Fewer than three in 10 18- to 29-year-olds approve of  Trump ’s job performance. Millennial voters played key roles in the 2017 elections and will likely be influencers in 2018.
Arguably the most reliable voting bloc for  Trump  — and the GOP — has been white evangelicals.  Trump  is very aware of this  frequently thanking the group for  its  support of  his  presidency.  He  has granted the Christian Broadcasting Network more interviews than  he  has given mainstream media organizations.

In an interview with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee   Trump  said lawmakers must repeal the legislative filibuster.
""They have to get rid of the just absolutely crazy voting where you need 60 — it's called the filibuster rule — it's a disaster ""  Trump  said. ""It's a disaster for the Republicans. They have to get rid of it. If they don't get rid of it  it's just a death sentence.""
 Trump  partly blamed this filibuster for the failure of the Republicans' latest attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
""I thought that when I got to the Oval Office I would have a bill on my desk. Repeal and replace  a beautiful healthcare bill  and it didn't happen ""  Trump  said.
This isn't the first time that  Trump  has brought up ending the filibuster: It is a frequent topic of  his  tweets. It also reportedly grates on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  contributing to the pair's frosty relationship.

4592,Opinion,Donald Trump,"We still don’t know the details of Donald Trump’s possible collusion with Russia  but as a result of his election  the febrile atmosphere Pomerantsev described has spread to the United States. Our politics feel dreamlike in their garish improbability; a running joke on Twitter is that the showrunners for this season of America have jumped the shark.
It sounds  of course  like an outrageous scam  and perhaps it is. But Vashukevich  who goes by the alias Nastya Rybka  has a documented link to Oleg Deripaska  an oligarch who figures prominently in one of the scandals surrounding the  Trump  campaign. Indeed  that link may be why she’s locked up in the first place. Whether you believe her or not  her bizarre  sordid story offers real clues to the chain connecting  Trump ’s circle to the highest level of the Russian government.
Deripaska  remember  is the oligarch that the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort offered to brief privately on the American presidential campaign. He’s been connected to Russian organized crime  and Manafort appeared to owe him a lot of money. (A court filing in the Cayman Islands said Manafort and his deputy  Rick Gates  couldn’t account for nearly $19 million that they were supposed to invest for a business controlled by Deripaska.) After joining the  Trump  campaign  Manafort emailed an intermediary  asking  apparently in reference to Deripaska  “How do we use to get whole?”
Navalny initially dismissed speculation that Deripaska had served as a back channel between the  Trump  campaign and the Kremlin. “Among all the conspiracy theories of American mass media  this part was the most unconvincing ” he said in the video. “Many oligarchs are close to Putin ” and there was no evidence that Deripaska was transmitting secret intelligence to him.","We still don’t know the details of [TGT] possible collusion with Russia  but as a result of [TGT] election  the febrile atmosphere Pomerantsev described has spread to the United States.

4593,Obama admin officials slam Trump's Iran deal announcement,Donald Trump,"Washington (CNN) Former Obama administration officials are decrying  President Donald Trump 's announcement that  he  will potentially halt the US' participation in the Iran nuclear deal  and are warning that the move could jeopardize the United States' position at the negotiating table for future agreements.
 Trump  formally announced on Friday  he  would pull out of the agreement completely if Congress and US allies do not work to address ""the deal's many serious flaws.""
Citing ""multiple violations of the agreement ""  Trump  said Iran had failed to meet  its  end of the 2015 deal. However  the International Atomic Energy Agency  American allies and the US government all have said Tehran is complying with the official pact.
Biden is one of several former officials from the Obama era -- the administration under which the deal was constructed -- who responded to  Trump  and shared their own set of concerns regarding the US' new approach.
In a statement issued on Friday  former Secretary of State John Kerry said  Trump 's decision is ""creating an international crisis.""
""Essentially   Trump  is urging Congress to do something that could precipitate a nuclear crisis with Iran at the same time that  he  is faced with a significant crisis on the Korean peninsula "" Rhodes said. ""What  Trump  is doing with Iran is going to make it that much harder for  him  to achieve any diplomatic resolution with North Korea.""
When criticizing the deal   Trump  said  he  took issue with the ""sunset"" provision. But former Obama officials pushed back.
""I think that this is entirely about  Trump 's annoyance with the certification process  which forces  him  to certify that Iran is complying with the deal  that the deal is working  and that all of  his  bombastic rhetoric about the deal has been based in dishonesty "" Rhodes said.

The author of a controversial book on  Donald Trump  says that all  his  White House aides see  him  as a ""child"" who needs ""immediate gratification"".
Michael Wolff said his book was based on about 200 interviews  and rejected  Mr Trump 's claims that it was ""phony"" and ""full of lies"".
The book has now gone on sale early despite  Mr Trump 's attempts to stop it.
 Mr Trump 's lawyers had tried to block publication of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House  alleging it contained many falsehoods and saying they were considering pursuing libel charges.
The meeting is being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of his inquiry into possible collusion between  Trump  campaign officials and Russians.
The  Trump  team was shocked and horrified by his election win
 Mr Trump  was angry that A-list stars had snubbed  his  inauguration

Donald Trump's supporters have seen many a media storm over the past few years  and somehow their man always emerges (relatively) unscathed. The book may be generating considerable heat among the chattering class  but there's little to indicate that its lasting impact will be much more than confirming long-held suspicions of  Trump  critics and re-enforcing the bunker mentality in the White House.

4595,TRUMP: 'We have to look' at trade 'almost as a war',Donald Trump,"President-elect Donald Trump  said Tuesday night in North Carolina that the US should view trade ""almost as a war.""
 Trump  promised the Fayetteville crowd during the second leg of  his  ""Thank You Tour"" that  his  administration would renegotiate trade deals and ""defeat the enemy on jobs.""
 Trump 's use of the word ""war"" might worry political leaders who have repeatedly expressed concern that the president-elect's tough talk on trade could ignite a trade war with another country.
On Monday  for instance  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy declined to support  Trump 's proposal to impose a 35% tariff on companies that leave the US  saying he didn't ""want to get into some type of trade war.""
“These dummies say  ‘Oh  that’s a trade war.’ Trade war? We’re losing $500 billion in trade with China. Who the hell cares if there’s a trade war?”  Trump  rhetorically asked an audience in May.
Throughout the campaign   Trump  promised to be tough on trade  going as far as to say during a rally earlier this year that the landmark Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement between 12 Pacific Rim nations would lead to ""a continuing rape of our country.""
Since taking office   Trump  and Indiana Gov. and Vice President-elect Mike Pence cut a deal with Carrier that provided the company with $7 million in tax incentives over 10 years to keep roughly 1 000 jobs  a portion that were set to be exported to Mexico  at an Indianapolis plant.
""And if a company wants to fire their workers  leave our country  and then ship their products back into the country  there will be consequences ""  Trump  told the crowd. ""I'm sorry  there will be consequences. Big consequences.""
 Trump  took aim at China as being a main culprit for the loss of many manufacturing jobs in the US  and said the country is ""living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.""
""There's never been a jobs theft like what's happened to this country ""  he  continued before mentioning the deal with Carrier. ""And we stopped some of it  a little bit  because we started  we just started.""
 Trump  also pointed to voters who supported  his  tough-on-trade rhetoric  which was likely a major reason  he  was able to pull out victories in Pennsylvania  Michigan  and Wisconsin
""Boy did they come out to vote ""  he  said. ""Remember when they said they don't exist? They existed! They existed! Believe me ... Millions and millions of people poured out to the voting booths.

4596,Trump mocks Republican senator's size,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  escalated  his  attacks on Sen. Bob Corker  a powerful Tennessee Republican  on Tuesday  calling  him  ""Liddle "" apparently mocking the senator's physical size.
 The president  has reportedly remarked on Corker's size before  telling aides that the 5-foot-7 lawmaker was too short to be his secretary of state  a position that Corker was reportedly in the running for.
Corker  who has been critical of  Trump  for the past several months  made headlines last week when  he  accused  Trump  of undermining Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's efforts to establish diplomatic channels with North Korea amid heightening tensions with the rogue nation. Corker also said that Tillerson  Defense Secretary James Mattis  and White House chief of staff John Kelly are ""those people that help separate our country from chaos.""
""Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee ""  Trump  wrote in a pair of tweets. ""I said 'NO' and  he  dropped out (said  he  could not win without...my endorsement).  He  also wanted to be Secretary of State  I said 'NO THANKS.'  He  is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!""
In response   Trump  accused the Times of secretly recording Corker's interview  despite the senator's explicit acknowledgement at the beginning of the interview that it was being recorded both by the Times and by two of  his  aides.
""The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording  his  conversation "" the president wrote. ""Was made to sound a fool  and that's what I am dealing with!""
 Trump  has a history of assigning unflattering nicknames to politicians  he  dislikes — calling Sen. Ted Cruz ""Lyin' Ted"" and Hillary Clinton ""Crooked Hillary"" — and  he 's repeatedly made remarks  both degrading and complimentary  about the stature of male politicians.

4597,How Donald Trump needs to exit the White House,Donald Trump,"President Trump  makes  his  way toward Air Force One before departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. (AFP/Getty Images)
Speculation about how long  Donald Trump  will last as president has been rampant since the spring. By summer it was quite clear that: a)  Trump  was not going to grow up in office; and b) the best staffing in the world would not be able to make  him  even a mediocre president. Yes  constitutional checks and balances are still working  but that is cold comfort when so many officials and analysts are talking so casually about war with North Korea.
So it is no surprise that some hope the Mueller investigation will bring  Trump  down  or that the president will eat himself into a coronary. It is certainly possible that these things will happen. As someone who has vehemently opposed  Trump  for years  however  I hope they do not.
Washington Post opinion writer Jennifer Rubin explains the probability of impeachment or enacting the 25th amendment in the  Trump  era. (Adriana Usero Kate Woodsome Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)
To be clear  it is not that I believe the Mueller investigation to be a fruitless endeavor. In a little over six months  the special counsel has managed to indict  Trump ’s former campaign manager and reach a plea deal with Trump’s first national security adviser. The more malfeasance Mueller and his team exposes  the better. He has done a far better job of draining the swamp than the president of the United States.
Still  if  Trump  is forced out by constitutional-but-unprecedented means  I fear the repercussions. Consider the 25th Amendment. As Ezra Klein observes — in a Vox article making the case for impeachment  no less — removing  Trump  this way would lead to all kinds of blowback:
Imagine that Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet did compel  Trump  to undergo psychiatric evaluation. And imagine the psychiatrist did return a diagnosis of some kind  be it early-stage dementia or narcissistic personality disorder (plenty of psychiatrists stand ready to diagnose  Trump  with all manner of mental ailments  so this is not far-fetched). The vote is taken  and  Trump  is removed from office. To many of  Trump ’s supporters — and perhaps many of  his  opponents — this would look like nothing less than a coup; the swamp swallowing the man who sought to drain it. Imagine the Breitbart headlines  the Fox News chyrons. And would they truly be wrong?
Of course  this also undercuts Klein’s argument for a lower threshold for impeachment. If  Trump  was removed from office that way  the political blowback would probably be the same. Regardless  in contrast to the 25th Amendment  impeaching and removing  Trump  from office remains a true hypothetical. In this polarized age  the only way  Trump  would be removed from office is if Democrats win 67 seats in the Senate. That is not going to happen anytime soon.
For  Trump  to lose properly   it  has to be at the ballot box.  Trump  has to run for reelection and be repudiated by American voters.  He  has to lose the popular vote again  get trounced in the electoral college  and see  his  party pay the consequences of backing the most ignorant  illiberal president in modern American history.
The absolute best way for  Trump  and Trumpism to be repudiated is through democratic and not merely legal means. If Doug Jones defeats Roy Moore in Alabama despite a presidential endorsement  that represents a blow to  Trump  in the same way he was humiliated by the Virginia state elections last month. If the GOP loses badly in the midterms despite a healthy economy  that is an even bigger repudiation of the head of the Republican Party. And if  Trump  loses bigly in  his  quest for reelection in 2020  such a resounding defeat might shock the GOP into repudiating white identity politics.
Electing  Trump  once was a fluke involving a fractured GOP  an unpopular Democrat nominee  and the Democrats having won the previous two terms. Electing  Trump  twice would be national suicide. If the United States has any chance at regaining its bearings as the greatest constitutional democracy in the world  the populist in chief must be revealed as genuinely unpopular. And it has to happen at the ballot box.","President Trump  makes  his  way toward Air Force One before departing from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. (AFP/Getty Images)

President  Donald Trump  endorsed barring those under 21 from buying semi-automatic weapons — a move that puts  him  in direct opposition with the National Rifle Association.

The shutdown began a year to the day after  Trump  was sworn in as president.

The Tweet is one of several recent occasions where  Trump  has claimed that the March 5 date is a deadline.
The March 5 deadline appeared in September when Attorney General Jeff Sessions admitted the illegality of former President Barack Obama’s DACA amnesty.  Trump  chose to wind down the DACA program by directing that the lower officials not extend the two-year work permits given to the DACA illegals.
Business groups have touted the March 5 deadline because they are rushing Congress to legally preserve the DACA program. They want the amnesty preserved to keep the 690 000 DACA people in the labor market  but also to deny  Trump  any political leverage that  he  could use to force Congress to accept a broader rewrite of immigration laws that would reduce the inflow of new workers and consumers each year.","[TGT] suggested February 5 that Congress faces a March 5 deadline for dealing with the 690 000 DACA illegals  even though the deadline has been vaporized by a California court.

4602,Is Trump Already Waffling on His 401(k) Promise?,Donald Trump,"House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady seemingly contradicted  President Trump’s  promise that Americans’ 401(k) retirement accounts will not be changed as a result of  his  promised tax reforms. When asked about it   Trump  responded with a serving of word salad rather than an emphatic reiteration of  his  promise.
Here is  Trump ’s tweet from earlier this week.
The top House tax writer on Wednesday signaled that Congress could still propose changes to a popular retirement savings plan in its tax bill  contradicting an assurance made by  President Donald Trump . At a Christian Science Monitor event  Rep. Kevin Brady said Republicans are “exploring a number of ideas” to “create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner.” The House is “continuing discussions with  the president ” in that area  the House Ways and Means Committee chairman said. “I do have a worry. Not enough Americans are saving ” Brady said at a separate Yahoo Finance conference later in the day. Brady said Republicans have “asked for ideas how Americans (can) save more and save earlier in their lives.”
When asked about Brady’s comments   Trump  seemed caught off guard and rambled a bit rather than restating  his  promise.
 Trump  was asked about comments from Rep. Kevin Brady  chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and an author of the forthcoming GOP tax bill  that there could be changes to retirement accounts like 401(k)s in the plan.
 Trump  said 401(k)s are “very important” to  him  because they benefit the middle class but suggested tweaks could be included. “Well maybe it is  maybe we’ll use it as negotiating  but trust me  that’s one of the great things ”  Trump  said. “There are certain elements of deals that you don’t want to negotiate with — and Kevin knows this  and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic — but he knows how important 401(k)s are.”
That seems a rather convoluted non-answer in light of the line  Trump  drew in the sand with  his  tweet. With President “Let’s Make a Deal ” one never knows whether a promise is a promise or if a promise is just an opening position for negotiation.","House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady seemingly contradicted  President Trump’s  promise that Americans’ 401(k) retirement accounts will not be changed as a result of  his  promised tax reforms.

4606,More Moore Means Less DACA Less Amnesty,Donald Trump,"Judge Roy Moore’s blowout victory rebukes the establishment GOP’s tacit support for a no-strings DACA amnesty  and it also refutes claims that GOP voters will quietly accept an immigration flip-flop by  President Donald Trump .
The 18-point win  amid a hurricane of spending for incumbent Sen. Luther Strange  comes as  Trump  considers a proposal by Democrats and business leaders  in which he would expand the 2012 DACA amnesty and flip-flop on his promise to build a border wall — but would only get an empty bag of “border security” promises.
Before the election  progressives argued that  Trump ’s supporters would meekly accept a huge amnesty if  Trump  flip-flopped. For example  MSNBC host Chris Hayes declared September 14:
There is predictable caterwauling from institutional white nationalist/populist outlets and figures like Coulter and Breitbart  but I think it’s very likely that the actual voters that make up his base would be absolutely fine with  Trump  cutting a deal on DACA … I think that with  Trump  leading the charge  that will bring along even some of the most ostensibly anti-immigration core of his voters.
Hayes’ claim is based on his view that  Trump ’s voters are powered by racial resentment  not by rational preferences about the impact of cheap-labor immigration on jobs  wages  and civic conflict. He wrote:
[The 2016 election] was never about the policies anyway  it was about who rules. Who has power. Whose voice is heard. If  Trump  is the one making the deals  then the deals are being made on the terms of  him  and  his  coalition and are therefore  by definition  not existential threats. But if/when Obama took those actions  they represented some kind of intolerable incursion  and further cementing of the power of  his  multi-racial coalition.

4608,Trump meeting with Republican leaders says welfare reform may have to wait,Donald Trump,"CAMP DAVID  Md. (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders  said after talks on Saturday that  they  would make an election-year push this year for an immigration overhaul and infrastructure spending but that welfare reform may have to wait for later.
 Trump  was joined for two days of talks with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and other top Republicans to sketch out a legislative agenda during a year in which they will battle to keep the U.S. Congress in Republican control in November elections.
Taking questions from reporters after the talks   Trump  said  he  planned an active year on the campaign trail on behalf of Republican candidates.
“They want me to be involved  and very involved ”  Trump  said of Republican leaders. “We have to have more Republicans ... So I will be actually working for incumbents and anybody else that has my kind of thinking.”The party that controls the White House typically loses seats in the first congressional election after a presidential election  and  Trump ’s relatively low approval rating could increase the chances of Republican losses.

Welfare reform  a priority for Ryan and other House Republicans  appeared to be waning as a  Trump  goal for this year.
 He  said “we are looking at it” but that the goal was to get a bipartisan deal on welfare reform. If that is not possible  the effort might be left to do later   he  said.
 Trump  called  his  top economic adviser  Gary Cohn  to the microphone to say  he  planned to stay in the administration. Cohn’s status has been in doubt since a tax overhaul was approved and his departure could rattle stock markets that have soared in recent months.
“Gary hopefully will be staying for a long time ”  Trump  said.
 Trump  said  he  also wants a bipartisan agreement on an immigration overhaul but the reality is that both sides are far apart on an agreement. Democrats do not want to fund the border wall that  Trump  has long sought and Republicans want any agreement to protect the “Dreamer” children of illegal immigrants to include increased border security.","CAMP DAVID  Md.

4609,A year out from Election Day how people feel about Trump's America,Donald Trump,"(CNN) Last year   President Donald Trump 's victory defied conventional wisdom and brought to a close a campaign that pitted the two most unpopular presidential candidates in the history of modern polling against one another.
A year out from the election   Trump  remains unpopular  as do the Democrats  the Republicans and Congress.
 Trump  has reached lows in  his  approval rating unseen by any president at this point in their presidency.
Modern Presidents wavered between 50 and 80% approval in the first 10 months of their presidencies in nearly every case.  Trump 's approval is in a category of its own  however.
 Trump  sees the same dynamic  as expected. And like the Republican Party overall   Trump 's support leans old  male and white.
Much has been made specifically about  his  support from the white working class. The latest CNN poll showed  Trump  continues to perform slightly better among white people without college degrees than whites with them.
61% 60% American voters say  Donald Trump  is “a strong person.” American voters say  Donald Trump  does not “share their values.” 56% 42% American voters say  Donald Trump  is not “honest.” Americans believe  Donald Trump  will be one of the worst presidents in US history.

 Trump  consistently earns high marks for strength. An October poll from Quinnipiac University is just one of the latest to enforce the trend.
However   Trump  has also consistently fared poorly on a number of other leadership qualities. The same poll enforced these trends as well  showing the public largely regards  him  as untrustworthy and not sharing their values.
Additionally  an October poll from Marist University showed most people did not expect  Trump  to be the stellar president  he  promised. A plurality said  he  would go down as one of the worst in history.
After  Trump  fired FBI Director James Comey  the Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to lead a special counsel investigation into all things Russia and any matters he should see fit to pursue in the course of that probe.
Near the end of October  Mueller's team indicted two former  Trump  campaign hands and revealed a guilty plea from a former  Trump  adviser.

4611,Trump slams 'haters and fools' for criticizing his remarks on Putin and Russian election meddling,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump hit back at his critics over his controversial remarks about Russian interference in the 2016 election.
On Twitter   Trump  asked when will the ""haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing?""
Earlier on Saturday   Trump  had told reporters that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin ""means it"" when he repeatedly said Russia did not meddle in the US election.
 President Donald Trump  on Saturday lashed out at those criticizing  him  for saying that  he  believed Russian President Vladimir Putin ""means it"" when  he  says Russia did not interfere in the US presidential election in 2016.
""When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing  not a bad thing ""  he  said on Twitter.

 He  continued  referring to former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton: ""Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton  as Secretary of State  was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button?

 Trump  also tweeted positively about  his  meeting with Putin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang  Vietnam.
""Good discussions on Syria. Hope for  his  help to solve  along with China the dangerous North Korea crisis. Progress being made ""  he  said.
 Trump  drew fierce backlash earlier on Saturday after  he  told reporters aboard Air Force One that  he  believed Putin's repeated denials that Russia attempted to sway the US election in  Trump 's favor.
"" He  said  he  didn't meddle.  He  said  he  didn't meddle ""  Trump  said. ""I asked  him  again. You can only ask so many times. I just asked  him  again.  He  said  he  absolutely did not meddle in our election.  He  did not do what they are saying  he  did.""

4612,Trump World doesn't respond well to Mueller obtaining emails,Donald Trump,"As the investigation into the Russia scandal has unfolded  there have been more than a few questions about  Donald Trump’s  legal team and some of the idiosyncratic arguments pushed by the president’s attorneys.
Indeed  it was just two weeks ago when one of  Trump’s  top lawyers argued – twice – that it’s impossible for a sitting president to obstruct justice. The contention was soon after rejected by  among others  one of  Trump ’s other lawyers.
 A top lawyer for President Donald Trump’s transition team  has accused a government agency of unlawfully turning over thousands of emails to special counsel Robert Mueller as part of  his  investigation into Russia’s election meddling and potential collusion with the  Trump  campaign. Kory Langhofer  general counsel to the transition team known as Trump for America (TFA)  wrote a letter to the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Saturday detailing claims that Mueller’s team had improperly received emails sent and received by  Trump  officials before the start of  his  administration.
As a rule  Mueller and  his  investigators say very little in response to assorted criticisms  but in this case  Peter Carr  a spokesperson for the special counsel’s office  told NBC News in a statement  “When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation  we have secured either the account owner’s consent or appropriate criminal process.”","As the investigation into the Russia scandal has unfolded  there have been more than a few questions about  Donald Trump’s  legal team and some of the idiosyncratic arguments pushed by the president’s attorneys.

4614,Trump Bucks Usual Aggression Opens The Door To Negotiations With North Korea,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  took a far more measured tone during  his  address to South Korea’s National Assembly on Wednesday  touting the option of diplomacy with North Korea while delivering a strong message to the country’s leader that it must end its nuclear weapons program.
Trump  speaking in Seoul as part of  his  12-day tour of Asia  delivered a direct and at times heavy-handed message to Kim Jong Un  telling the North Korean leader: “Do not underestimate us. Do not try us.”
Other  Trump  administration officials  including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  have said diplomacy would remain on the table “until the first bomb drops.”
 Trump’s  speech Wednesday  which included a sweeping history of the conflict on the Korean peninsula  included some overt hits at the North  including  his  assertion that the region “is a country ruled by a cult.”  He  pointed to human rights abuses by Pyongyang against its own people and acts of aggression including the recent death of American student Otto Warmbier  who  Trump  said was “tortured” to death.
“We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction  we will not be intimidated and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here  on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure ”  Trump  said. “To those nations that choose to ignore this threat ― or  worse still  to enable it ― the weight of this crisis is on your conscience.”
A surprise visit by  Trump  and Moon to the Korean Demilitarized Zone  the heavily-armed buffer region between North and South Korea  was canceled at the last minute on Wednesday due to poor weather. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the planned visit  even though it did not take place  was of a “historic nature” and showed “the strength of the alliance” between the U.S. and South Korea.","[TGT]took a far more measured tone during  [TGT]  address to South Korea’s National Assembly on Wednesday  touting the option of diplomacy with North Korea while delivering a strong message to the country’s leader that it must end its nuclear weapons program.

4616,Senate rejects immigration bills; young immigrants in limbo,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate has left hundreds of thousands of “Dreamer” immigrants in limbo  rejecting rival plans that would have spared them from deportation and strengthened the nation’s border security. Senators dealt  President Donald Trump  an especially galling defeat as more than a quarter of fellow Republicans abandoned  him  on an issue that helped propel  him  to the White House.
Also defeated Thursday was a plan by a bipartisan group of senators who offered a compromise that would have shielded the young immigrants and financed  Trump’s  demands for money to build  his  border wall  though more gradually than  he  wants. Eight Republicans joined most Democrats in backing that plan  but it fell short after the White House threatened a veto and GOP leaders opposed it.
“It looks like demagogues on the left and the right win again on immigration ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham  R-S.C.  who helped craft the bipartisan package but also backed  Trump ’s plan. He added  “The only way forward is for  President Trump  to grab the reins and lead us to a solution.”
That scenario wasn’t in sight Thursday. The White House trashed the bipartisan proposal as “dangerous policy that will harm the nation ” denouncing a provision directing the government to prioritize enforcement efforts against immigrants who arrive illegally — beginning in July.  Trump  proved unwilling to fold on  his  demands for a tougher bill  reflecting the hard-line immigration stance that fueled  his  presidential run.
After the Senate rejected all four proposals on Thursday  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R-Ky.  blamed Democrats for failing to accept what he said was a “generous” offer from  Trump .
“They turned away from a golden opportunity to solve the issue ” said McConnell. He expressed openness to considering a future compromise but said  “For that to happen  Democrats will need to take a second look” at  Trump ’s demands.
 Trump  had dangled a chance for citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants  meeting a top Democratic demand. But that plan also included $25 billion to build  his  border wall with Mexico and enact other border security measures  tighter curbs on relatives whom legal immigrants could sponsor for citizenship and an end to a visa lottery that encourages immigration from diverse nations.
Democrats said  Trump  was the major hindrance to a broader deal.
“This vote is proof that  President Trump’s  plan will never become law ” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. “If he would stop torpedoing bipartisan efforts  a good bill would pass.”
The Senate derailed  Trump ’s proposal by voting 60-39 against it — 21 votes shy of the 60 it needed to survive.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate has left hundreds of thousands of “Dreamer” immigrants in limbo  rejecting rival plans that would have spared them from deportation and strengthened the nation’s border security.

4617,Government shutdown begins on anniversary of Trump's inauguration,Donald Trump,"Americans awoke Saturday to learn that quarreling politicians in Washington had failed to keep their government in business  halting all but the most essential operations and marring the anniversary of President Donald Trump's inauguration.
It was a striking display of Washington dysfunction  and the finger-pointing came quickly.  Trump  tweeted that Democrats ""wanted to give me a nice present"" to mark the start of  his  second year in office.
The closure began at the start of a weekend  so many of the immediate effects will be muted for most Americans. Damage could build quickly if the closure is prolonged. And it comes with no shortage of embarrassment for  Trump  and political risk for both parties  as they wager that voters will punish the other at the ballot box in November.
 Trump  said Democrats ""could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead."" In a series of tweets hours after the shutdown began  the president tried to make the case for Americans to elect more Republicans to Congress in November ""in order to power through this mess."" He noted that there are 51 Republicans in the 100-member Senate  and it often takes 60 votes to advance legislation.
""Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous"" border with Mexico   Trump  tweeted.
Republicans branded the confrontation a ""Schumer shutdown "" after New York's Chuck Schumer  the Democratic leader. He said a "" Trump  shutdown"" was more accurate.
Earlier Friday   Trump  had brought Schumer to the White House in hopes of cutting a deal on a short-term spending agreement.
 Trump  had been an unreliable negotiator in the weeks leading up to the showdown. Earlier this week  he  tweeted opposition to the four-week plan  forcing the White House to later affirm  his  support.  He  expressed openness to extending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  only to reject a bipartisan proposal.  His  disparaging remarks about African and Haitian immigrants last week helped derail further negotiations.
 Trump  had been set to leave Friday afternoon to attend a fundraiser at  his  Palm Beach  Florida  estate marking the inauguration anniversary but delayed  his  travel.
The last shutdown came in 2013. Tea party Republicans  in a strategy not unlike the one Schumer is employing now  sought to use a must-pass budget bill to try to force President Barack Obama to delay implementation of his health care law. At the time   Trump  told ""Fox & Friends"" that the ultimate blame for a shutdown lies at the top. ""I really think the pressure is on the president "" he said.
Arguing that  Trump 's predecessors ""weaponized"" that shutdown  Mulvaney said his budget office would direct agencies to work to mitigate the impact this time. That position is a striking role reversal for the conservative former congressman who was one of the architects of the 2013 shutdown.","Americans awoke Saturday to learn that quarreling politicians in Washington had failed to keep their government in business  halting all but the most essential operations and marring the anniversary of President [TGT]'s inauguration.

4619,President Trump leaning toward Powell as next Fed chair: sources,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is leaning toward nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to be the next head of the U.S. central bank  two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five   Trump  had not made a final decision and could always change his mind.
“I will be announcing it sometime next week ”  Trump  said in a video statement on Instagram. “It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job. I have someone very specific in mind and I think everyone will be very impressed.”
 Trump  has said  he  has been considering Powell  as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor  for the post.  He  also has said  he  has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen  whose term expires in February.

 Trump  had been working from a short list of five candidates that included  his  top economic adviser  Gary Cohn  and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.
A senior administration official said on Wednesday that  Trump  was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact tax reform legislation currently being debated in Congress.
 Trump  has also privately voiced a desire to put  his  own stamp on the central bank  which has dimmed the prospect of  him  giving a new term to Yellen  another source said.

4622,The Latest: Top Democrat says vote to release memo invalid,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on investigations into contacts between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia (all times local):
The panel voted Monday to publicly release the memo  part of a GOP effort to prove improper use of surveillance by the FBI in its Russia investigation.  President Donald Trump  has five days from the vote to review the document.
The FBI has declared that it has ""grave concerns"" about the accuracy of  a classified memo on the Russia election investigation that President Donald Trump wants released .
The agency's stance on  the memo  means that  Trump  would be openly defying  his  hand-picked FBI director by continuing to push for  the memo 's disclosure.
 The four-page memo  was drafted by Republicans on the House intelligence committee.
The Republicans have said  the memo  reveals surveillance abuses by the FBI and the Justice Department in the early stages of the investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign.
Document requests and recent witness interviews show Mueller is keenly interested in Flynn's time in the White House and  President Donald Trump 's decision to fire  him .

The president has also nominated Marvin Goodfriend  a conservative economist  for another vacancy on the board.
In addition   he  can fill three more vacancies on the seven-member board  including the key spot of Fed vice chairman  which has been vacant since Stanley Fischer left in October.

4629,U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts  the Pentagon said on Friday  after  President Donald Trump’s administration  decided not to appeal rulings that blocked  his  transgender ban.
Two federal appeals courts  one in Washington and one in Virginia  last week rejected  the administration’s  request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1.
A Justice Department official said  the administration  will not challenge those rulings.
“The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs   the administration  has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime ” the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity.
In September  the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by  Trump  to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to  Trump .

In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters   Trump  announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military  reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them.  Trump  said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”
The  Trump  administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.”
The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1  2017  to begin accepting transgender recruits. But  Trump ’s defense secretary  James Mattis  postponed that date to Jan. 1  2018  which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely.
 Trump  has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October   his  administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees  reversing another Obama-era position.

Northwestern University law professor Eugene Kontorovich said  Trump  was not breaking any new ground when he announced a national emergency but said “such a declaration does have to be transmitted to Congress in writing.” “Relevant monies won’t be released until such a thing is signed ” Kontorovich told NBC News. “Usually presidents will announce something and sign it at the same time as a photo-op kind of thing.

4631,Gavin Newsom Vows to Keep CA a Sanctuary State Defy & Resist Trump,Donald Trump,"California Lieutenant Governor and gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newsom is ramping up his pro-amnesty rhetoric  vowing to keep California a “sanctuary state” for illegal immigrants while defying and resisting  President Donald Trump .
“Let me be clear  @realDonaldTrump: California is a sanctuary state. We believe in the power of diversity.

We will do it again ” the left-wing Democrat tweeted on Friday in response to the  Trump ’s administration’s plans to crack down on illegal immigration in Northern California.

4633,Trump's high,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) —  President Donald Trump  unveiled a $4.4 trillion budget plan Monday that envisions steep cuts to America's social safety net but mounting spending on the military  formally retreating from last year's promises to balance the federal budget.
 The president 's spending outline for the first time acknowledges that the Republican tax overhaul passed last year would add billions to the deficit and not ""pay for itself"" as  Trump  and  his  Republican allies asserted. If enacted as proposed  though no presidential budget ever is  the plan would establish an era of $1 trillion-plus yearly deficits.
The open embrace of red ink is a remarkable public reversal for  Trump  and  his  party  which spent years objecting to President Barack Obama's increased spending during the depths of the Great Recession. Rhetoric aside  however   Trump 's pattern is in line with past Republican presidents who have overseen spikes in deficits as they simultaneously increased military spending and cut taxes.
""We're going to have the strongest military we've ever had  by far ""  Trump  said in an Oval Office appearance Monday. ""In this budget we took care of the military like it's never been taken care of before.""
 Trump 's budget revived  his  calls for big cuts to domestic programs that benefit the poor and middle class  such as food stamps  housing subsidies and student loans. Retirement benefits would remain mostly untouched by  Trump 's plan  as  he  has pledged  though Medicare providers would absorb about $500 billion in cuts — a nearly 6 percent reduction. Some beneficiaries in Social Security's disability program would have to re-enter the workforce under proposed changes to eligibility rules.
While all presidents' budgets are essentially dead on arrival — Congress writes and enacts its own spending legislation —  Trump 's plan was dead before it landed. It came just three days after the president signed a bipartisan agreement that set broad parameters for spending over the next two years. That deal  which includes large increases for domestic programs  rendered Monday's  Trump  plan for 10-year  $1.7 trillion cuts to domestic agencies such as the departments of Health and Human Services  Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development even more unrealistic.
But after his aides talked up that plan over the weekend   Trump  suggested that  his  infrastructure proposal wasn't a big deal for  him .
""If for any reason   they  don't want to support to it  hey  that's going to be up to  them  ""  he  said of the Republican-controlled Congress. ""What was very important to  me  was the military; what was very important to  me  was the tax cuts.""
 Trump  also is proposing work requirements for several federal programs  including housing subsidies  food stamps and Medicaid. Such ideas have backing from powerful figures in Congress including Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin  who promises action on a ""workforce development"" agenda this year.
""The  Trump  budget proposal makes clear  his  desire to enact massive cuts to health care  anti-poverty programs and investments in economic growth to blunt the deficit-exploding impact of  his  tax cuts for millionaires and corporations "" said Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky  the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
All told  the new budget sees accumulating deficits of $7.2 trillion over the coming decade;  Trump 's plan last year projected a 10-year shortfall of $3.2 trillion. And that's assuming Trump's rosy economic predictions come true and Congress follows through — in an election year — with politically toxic cuts to social programs  farm subsidies and Medicare providers.
Last year  Trump 's budget promised such ideas could generate a small budget surplus by 2027; now  his best-case scenario is for a $450 billion deficit that year  more than $300 billion of which can be traced to his December tax cut.
Instead   Trump 's budget projects that tax revenues will plummet by $3.7 trillion over the 2018-27 decade relative to last year's ""baseline"" estimates.
The budget also includes $1.6 billion for the second stage of  Trump 's proposed border wall  a 65-mile segment in Texas' Rio Grande Valley.  Trump 's request last year for 74 miles of wall in San Diego and the Rio Grande Valley is pending before lawmakers right now.
Once again  there's no mention of how Mexico would have to pay for it  as  Trump  repeatedly promised during the presidential campaign and after  his  victory.
 Trump 's plan promises 3 percent growth for the nation's economy  continuing low inflation and low interest yields on U.S. Treasury bills despite a flood of new borrowing. That likely underestimates the mounting cost of financing the government's $20 trillion-plus debt  many economists say.","WASHINGTON (AP) —  [TGT]unveiled a $4.4 trillion budget plan Monday that envisions steep cuts to America's social safety net but mounting spending on the military  formally retreating from last year's promises to balance the federal budget.

4639,Trump defends gun control climate change positions in wide,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump defended  his  positions on climate change  gun control and even  his  tweeting and eating habits during a rare  wide-ranging interview with British television personality Piers Morgan.

In a previously unseen excerpt  Morgan asked  Trump  what was being done to stop shootings in the U.S. in the wake of this past week's high school shooting in Kentucky in which two 15-year-old students died and more than 18 others were wounded.
When Morgan repeated that Paddock had bought 55 guns   Trump  said: ""The point is   he  would have had 55 bombs.  He  would have had 55 of something else.""
""I’m a Second Amendment person. I think you need it for security ""  Trump  said. ""You've had so many attacks  where there was only a gun -– a bad person’s gun -– going in this direction and if you had one on the other side. In fact  that’s a very big example. And if they had the bullets going in the opposite direction  you would have saved a lot of lives.""
When asked about  his  decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord and whether  he  believes climate change exists   Trump  answered  ""There is a cooling and there's a heating -- I mean  look  it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming ""  Trump  said. ""That wasn't working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt. They were going to be gone by now  but now they're setting records  okay? They're at a record level.
""I'll tell you what I believe in ""  Trump  continued. ""I believe in clean air. I believe in crystal clear  beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness and all.""
 Trump  added  ""We could go back into the Paris Accord  but  it  would have to be a completely different deal. As usual  they took advantage of the United States. We were in a terrible deal.""
Later  when Morgan asked  Trump  to respond to how he's portrayed -- as Morgan put it -- as either someone delivering on his promises or a ""raging  tweeting  wrecking ball who's destroying the country and terrifying the entire planet ""  Trump  replied  ""I plead not guilty. I think I shook things up. The country had to be shaken up.""
On whether his tweeting habits distracted from his message   Trump  said  he  doesn't call  it  tweeting but instead ""social media"" -- what  he  said is ""a modern-day form of communication""  he  uses to counter ""fake news.""
“Well  perhaps sometimes in bed and perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever ""  Trump  responded. ""But generally speaking  during the early morning or during the evening  I can do that. But if I’m very busy during the day I’ll sometimes just dictate out something really quickly and I’ll give it to one of my people to put it on.”
Morgan also asked  Trump  about his health following his recent physical.
""Which most people are not going to do too well ""  Trump  said.
When Morgan noted  Trump  had called himself a ""stable genius ""  Trump  answered  ""Yep. I am a stable genius.""
 Trump  responded: ""Don't want to change it. Nope -- don't want to change that  no.
""They build that up. I eat fine food ""  Trump  continued. ""I eat really the finest -- some of the finest chefs in the world. I eat healthy food. I also have some of that food on occasion. Sometimes it makes sense. Actually  when you're campaigning  there's a lot of sense to it because it's you know  boom boom boom.

4640,Trump 's tweets: Unflinchingly candid and defiant,Donald Trump,"This  in a nutshell  is my analysis of President Donald Trump’s tweets:
They are unflinchingly candid and defiant in the face of political correctness. Occasionally the tweets’ wording is clumsy  and their timing is awkward. But  always   Trump  says what  he  means. Like  President Ronald Reagan  Trump  is a man of a few simple  large ideas. We can extrapolate  his  domestic and foreign policies from  his  body of relevant tweets: lower taxes and fewer regulations  the wall  the emasculation of Obamacare  and the assertion of American military power. However  unlike Reagan  who was witty and self-effacing   Trump  commands the language with cupped hands.  He  wields superlative adjectives the way a shot-putter heaves an iron ball  with mindless vigor rather than precision.
Any tweet  Trump  sends out that doesn’t have to do with less intrusive government  or illegal immigration  or international challenges to American interests  we may frankly regard as Twitter trash. These extraneous tweets serve only to feed the media’s frenzy. The same news media which breezily allowed former President Barack Obama’s scandals and blunders to escape their notice now turn their focus on Trump’s every misstep  like searchlights on a wart.
Obama’s political locution was unnervingly suave. To my ears  however  Obama sounded like a passive-aggressive firebrand. Whenever he opened his mouth  I heard: “You suck.” For eight years  I endured his lectures and insinuated insults. Forgive me for relishing the left’s hysteria over  Trump ’s slangy pronouncements.
Hillary Clinton lost because she lacked Obama’s smooth rhetorical obfuscation. Her speechifying exuded the boredom and tension of snarled traffic. Compared to her  at the debates   Trump  was positively Whitman-esque.
I don’t even use a smartphone. I can gauge the effect of  Trump ’s tweets only from the pained uproar of the media. How tweet it is — says  Trump  to them — to be loathed by you!","This  in a nutshell  is my analysis of President [TGT]’s tweets:

4641,Why understanding the political influence of social media extends beyond Russia,Donald Trump,"Our research examined the Twitter followers of both  Donald Trump  and Hillary Clinton  and the sources of information and brands that their supporters follow: 648 brands followed by more than 19 million  Trump  and Clinton supporters collectively. By analyzing the President’s and former Secretary of State’s followers and those they follow  we were able to glean insight into the brand preferences of each politician’s followers  such as what news  beer and car brands they consume or are likely to choose.
The “Brand Universes” of  Donald Trump  and Hillary Clinton supports the widely-held beliefs about the profiles and demographics of the two candidates’ supporters. For example  President  Trump ’s Twitter followers had strong affinity with the alcoholic brands Budweiser  Coors  Jim Beam  Maker’s Mark; sports brands and media such as Ping  the Golf Chanel and Fox Sports; financial and media brands such as SmartyPig  Mint  MarketWatch  Fox Business  and the Drudge Report. Secretary Clinton’s followers  on the other hand  showed strong attraction for brands that are often associated with women and millennials such as Gap  Maybelline  Cover Girl  and J. Crew and media channels that speak to liberal audiences such as The Atlantic  Vox  Aljazeera America and Ebony Magazine.
By combining these brand universes with consumer data from Young & Rubicam’s BrandAsset Valuator (BAV) model  we are able to unearth the personality characteristics of each politician’s followers by the brands they follow. The brands monitored by  Donald Trump’s  followers were characterized as: straightforward; down to earth; rugged; unstylish; and non-trendy. The brands tracked by Hillary Clinton’s followers were described as: intelligent; socially responsible; glamorous; not fun; and not energetic. Interestingly  these characteristics were commonly associated with the two politicians themselves.
The takeaway is stark: by using this data  if you tell us who you follow on social media  we can assess your political affiliation and who you are likely to vote for in the future. Indeed   President Trump’s  electoral success has been partially attributed to  his  ability to harness the power of Twitter and tailor  his  rhetoric to reflect the values of  his  followers.
The same social media source that allows  Donald Trump  to instantly reach  his  followers can be used to help us better understand how brand associations can unduly reinforce political bias and fuel the polarization of our nation.","Our research examined the Twitter followers of both  [TGT]and Hillary Clinton  and the sources of information and brands that their supporters follow: 648 brands followed by more than 19 million  [TGT]  and Clinton supporters collectively.

4642,Trump retweets image depicting 'CNN' squashed beneath his shoe,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump on Christmas Eve retweeted a doctored image with the CNN logo imposed on a bloodlike splatter under  his  shoe  prompting an outcry — with critics deeming the picture and its timing offensive.
The image had originated from a Twitter account named ""oregon4TRUMP "" as a reply to one of  Trump 's tweets boasting about  his  first-year achievements.
""So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration  perhaps more than any other President in first year ""  Trump  had tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Sadly  will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!""
""Thank you  President TRUMP !!"" oregon4TRUMP replied  adding an apparently altered image of  Trump  in the back of a car with the crushed CNN logo on the sole of  his  left shoe. The image had additional text superimposed on it that read  ""WINNING.""
On Sunday morning  in between tweets promoting a conspiracy theory about FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and attacking ""Fake News"" and ""Fake Polls ""  Trump  retweeted the image to  his  more than 45 million followers.
CNN anchor Jake Tapper noted  Trump 's tweet with a simple observation: ""CNN-labeled blood on the sole of his shoe. Retweeted by the President of the United States on Christmas Eve.""
In response to Tapper  Jason Osborne  a former  Trump  campaign adviser  defended the image and accused Tapper of ""(making) everything about your network.""
The image was of a bug because it ""clearly has eyes "" Osborne insisted. He also argued that  Trump  may not have noticed the CNN logo at the bottom of his shoe and retweeted the picture because he liked the way he looked in it.
Trump has had a contentious relationship with the press since his campaign  regularly lashing out at certain media outlets — even individual journalists — and accusing many publications and news stations of being ""fake news."" CNN has regularly been the subject of  Trump 's attacks  on Twitter and in speeches. Earlier this month  after CNN apologized for mistakenly reporting the timing of a WikiLeaks-related email   Trump  used the error as an opportunity to attack the network again.
""CNN apologized just a little while ago ""  Trump  said at a rally in Pensacola  Fla. ""They apologized. Oh  thank you  CNN. Thank you so much. You should've been apologizing for the last two years.""
Sunday's tweet was not the first time that  Trump  has shared a doctored image on Twitter  particularly related to CNN. In July — on another Sunday morning  just before Independence Day —  Trump  tweeted an edited video clip that showed  him  slamming a man with ""CNN"" superimposed on  his  head to the ground. In the video   Trump  then throws punches at the man's head  before walking away.
 Trump  appended the tweet with two hashtags: ""#FraudNewsCNN"" and ""#FNN.""
That tweet prompted a round of condemnation from mostly Democratic lawmakers  who blasted  Trump  for being ""crude  false  and unpresidential."" A little-known Reddit user claimed credit for the doctored CNN video; the fact that the president had sent it out to his millions of followers soon reverberated across r/The_Donald  a pro-Trump Reddit subgroup  as The Washington Post's Avi Selk reported:

4643,Exclusive: Trump accuses Russia of helping North Korea evade sanctions; says U.S. needs more missile defense,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  complained on Wednesday that Russia was helping North Korea to evade international sanctions  signaling frustration with a country  he  had hoped to forge friendly relations with after  his  2016 election win.
“Russia is not helping us at all with North Korea ”  Trump  said during an Oval Office interview with Reuters. “What China is helping us with  Russia is denting. In other words  Russia is making up for some of what China is doing.”
 Trump  said  he  hoped the standoff with Pyongyang could be resolved “in a peaceful way  but  it ’s very possible that  it  can’t.”
Asked whether  he  thought the United States needs more missile defense systems   he  said  “Yes  yes I do. We’re ordering more missile defense and we’re ordering more missile offense also.”
 Trump  praised China for  its  efforts to restrict oil and coal supplies to North Korea but said Beijing could do much more to help constrain Pyongyang.
 Trump  has repeatedly blamed a U.S. investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election for hindering an improvement in U.S.-Russian relations.
“ He  can do a lot ”  Trump  said of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “But unfortunately  we  don’t have much of a relationship with Russia  and in some cases it’s probable that what  China  takes back  Russia gives. So the net result is not as good as it could be.”
 U.S. President Donald Trump  speaks during an interview with Reuters at the White House in Washington  U.S.  January 17  2018. REUTERS/ Kevin Lamarque
Trump  said Pyongyang is steadily advancing in  its  ability to deliver a missile to the United States.
“They’re not there yet  but they’re close. And they get closer every day ”  he  said.
They said  however  that North Korea had not yet offered any proof that it had mastered all technical hurdles  including development of  a re-entry vehicle needed to deliver a heavy nuclear warhead reliably atop an ICBM .
 Trump  said  he  welcomed talks between North and South Korea over the Winter Olympics to be held in the South next month and said this could be an initial phase in helping defuse the crisis.
 He  would not say whether the United States has been considering a limited  pre-emptive attack to show the North that the United States means business.
“We’re playing a very  very hard game of poker and you don’t want to reveal your hand ”  he  said.
“We have a very big intellectual property potential fine going  which is going to come out soon ”  Trump  said.
 Trump  said the damages could be high  without elaborating on how the numbers were reached or how the costs would be imposed.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  [TGT]complained on Wednesday that Russia was helping North Korea to evade international sanctions  signaling frustration with a country  [TGT]  had hoped to forge friendly relations with after  [TGT]  2016 election win.

4644,Trump says open to temporary healthcare reform deal with Democrats,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  said on Saturday  he  would be open to cutting a one-year or two-year deal with Democratic rivals as a way to kick-start reform of the nation’s healthcare system  a key campaign pledge made by  Trump  and the Republican Party.
 Trump  has been frustrated by the failure  openly taunting Republicans as “total quitters” and “fools” this summer over their inability in the Senate to replace Obamacare.
“If we made a temporary deal  I think it would be a great thing for people  but it’s really up to them (Democrats) ”  Trump  told reporters at the White House.
“So if we could do a one-year deal or two-year deal as a temporary measure  you’ll have block granting ultimately to the states  which is what Republicans want ”  Trump  said.
Earlier on Saturday  Trump  said  he  had called Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to gauge interest in working on what  he  called a “great” healthcare bill to replace Obamacare.
“I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill ”  Trump  wrote on Twitter earlier on Saturday. “ObamaCare is badly broken  big premiums. Who knows!”
Axios first reported  Trump ’s call to Schumer on Friday.

4645,Trump: Would 'love to' face Mueller questions _ under oath,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) —  President Donald Trump  declared late Wednesday  he ’s “looking forward” to being questioned — under oath — in the special counsel’s probe of Russian election interference and possible  Trump  obstruction in the firing of the FBI director.
 Trump  said  he  would be willing to answer questions under oath in the interview  which special counsel Robert Mueller has been seeking but which White house officials had not previously said the president would grant.
“I’m looking forward to it  actually ”  Trump  said when asked by reporters at the White House. Ad for timing   he  said  “I guess they’re talking about two or three weeks  but I’d love to do it.”
 He  said  as  he  has repeatedly  that “there’s no collusion whatsoever” with the Russians  and  he  added  “There’s no obstruction whatsoever.”
The full scope of Mueller’s investigation  which involves hundreds of thousands of documents and dozens of witness interviews  is unknown. And there have been no signs that agents aren’t continuing to work on ties between  Trump ’s campaign and a Russian effort to tip the 2016 election.
But now that Mueller’s team has all but concluded its interviews with current and former  Trump  officials  and expressed interest in speaking with the president himself  the focus seems to be on the post-inauguration White House. That includes the firing of FBI Director James Comey and discussions preceding the ouster of White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
The timing and circumstances of a  Trump  interview are still being ironed out. But soon it will probably be the president himself who will have to explain to Mueller how his actions don’t add up to obstruction of justice. And that conversation will be dominated by questions tied whether he took steps to thwart an FBI investigation.
A focus on potential obstruction has been evident almost since Mueller’s appointment as special counsel. And recent interviews with administration officials  including Attorney General Jeff Sessions  have shown that  Trump  is dealing with prosecutors who already have amassed a wealth of knowledge about the events  he ’ll be questioned about.
Prosecutors have interviewed numerous White House aides including  Trump ’s closest confidants such as Counsel Don McGahn  former chief of staff Reince Priebus and the president’s son-in-law  Jared Kushner.
Sessions  the target of the president’s ire since he stepped aside last March from the Russia investigation  would have been able to offer close-up insight into the president’s thinking ahead of the termination. He also could have been able to speak to the president’s relationship with Comey  which Comey documented in a series of memos about conversations with  Trump  that bothered him.
In one memo  Comey described a January 2017 meeting over dinner at which he said the president asked him to pledge his loyalty. Separately  a person familiar with the conversation said this week that  Trump  in a meeting last year with Deputy Director Andrew McCabe brought up McCabe’s wife’s political background following the revelation that she had accepted campaign contributions during a state Senate run from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe  a close Clinton ally.
The Washington Post reported Tuesday night that  Trump  had also asked McCabe whom he voted for in the presidential race. McCabe replied that he did not vote.  Trump  said Wednesday  he  did not recall asking that question.
Another of Comey’s memos centered on a February conversation at the White House in which  he  said  Trump  told  him   he  believed Flynn  the fired national security adviser  was a “good guy” and encouraged Comey to drop an investigation into him. The FBI had interviewed Flynn weeks earlier about whether  he  had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador during the transition period between the election and the inauguration. Flynn pleaded guilty in December to lying to the FBI during that interview.
 Mueller  has been investigating the events leading up to Flynn’s dismissal from the White House  including how officials responded to information from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates that Flynn had misled them by saying that  he  had not discussed sanctions. Despite that warning  and despite an FBI interview days after Trump’s inauguration  Flynn was not forced to resign until Feb. 13 — the night of media reports about Yates’ conversation with McGahn.","WASHINGTON (AP) —  [TGT]declared late Wednesday  [TGT] ’s “looking forward” to being questioned — under oath — in the special counsel’s probe of Russian election interference and possible  [TGT]  obstruction in the firing of the FBI director.

4646,Trump vs. Corker encapsulates GOP civil war,Donald Trump,"Trump  reignited the clash Tuesday  saying on Twitter that ""Liddle' Bob Corker"" had been made to ""sound a fool"" in an interview recorded by The New York Times.
""That's what I am dealing with ""  he  wrote.
The first is that there are now effectively two Republican parties -- one dominated by  Trump  and  his  uber-loyal followers  for whom  his  feud with Corker represents exactly the kind of disruption they hoped to see  him  unleash. The other GOP  meanwhile  is made up of establishment  orthodox conservatives like the Tennessee senator and his Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who want to use their power to legislate and fret about  Trump 's global leadership.
The second rule of last year's Republican primary circus is one that Corker is now daring to confound -- namely that no one who gets down in the muck with a brutal political street-fighter like  Trump  comes out clean or unscathed.  Trump 's showdown with Corker  which went nuclear over the weekend  will go a long way to deciding the state of the GOP as it musters for midterm elections next year -- at which its monopoly in Washington will be on the line.
It could also show whether  Trump 's go-to tactic of waging war on the Republican Party establishment  that has proven so profitable in the past  is a viable strategy going forward or whether it is ultimately self-defeating.  Trump  briefly toed the party line in backing Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in  his  losing primary race against Roy Moore last month -- but even before voters went to the polls  he admitted he might have done the wrong thing.
""But  Donald Trump  challenged the Republican establishment -- there are a lot of Republicans like  me  that quite frankly were sick of the same old  same old ...  he  has continued to fight the system "" Bauer added.
There have been signs that if  Trump  fails to secure results on Capitol Hill   he  could effectively become the first sitting Republican president to run against a do-nothing Congress of  his  own party in the midterms  perhaps by backing insurgent GOPers in primary races against establishment lawmakers.
And from the party's grassroots  Corker's intervention may seem less consequential than it did in Washington  which was transfixed by the spat that culminated when  the senator  warned  Trump 's volatile temperament could put the US on the path to ""World War III.""
Some Washington pundits and media commentators praised Corker for having the courage to finally stand up to  Trump   for voicing what many GOP figures say privately and for no longer appeasing what they see as the President's dangerous approach to crises like the standoff with North Korea.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that  Trump  was channeling frustration against the Washington GOP's struggles to implement his agenda.
But in Washington  the President's record for knockouts has been less effective.

His  efforts to help repeal Obamacare  for instance  often seemed ill-informed or counterproductive.
And when Republican Sen. John McCain stood up to  Trump 's power and helped derail a last ditch bid to repeal Obamacare   he polished his own legacy -- at least in Washington -- and won sympathy when the President attacked him shortly after his brain cancer diagnosis.
On Monday  many Beltway strategists and senior Republicans were left shaking their heads  warning that  Trump 's reflexive lashing out could cost  him  the crucial vote of Corker as  he  seeks a year-end legislative victory.
Unusually  the White House allowed cameras to record  Trump  on the golf course  sending a message that Corker's revolt was not uniform among GOP senators. Less than two months ago  Graham was castigating the President over his sluggish condemnation of white supremacists after racial violence in Charlottesville  Virginia  warning ""history is watching us all.""

4650,Trump and senators talk immigration after government shutdown deal,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump started fresh immigration talks with senators on Monday as bipartisan lawmakers struck a deal to end the U.S. government shutdown that hinged largely on their ability to reach an immigration compromise.
The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  which shielded certain immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children and allowed them to work  will start to phase out on March 5.  Trump  announced  his  decision to end the program in September.
Earlier this month   Trump  told bipartisan lawmakers to strike an immigration deal that  he  would subsequently sign. Two days later  Sens. Lindsey Graham  R-S.C.  and Dick Durbin  D-Ill.  presented him a deal they brokered  but he rejected it.
On Friday  Schumer attempted to negotiate an immigration deal with  Trump   to no avail. Kelly called the New York Democrat to tell him his terms were too liberal for the GOP.
Schumer later said he put funding for  Trump 's proposed border wall on the table. It was previously a dealbreaker for many Democrats  but they have warmed to the proposal as the prospects of an immigration deal became dimmer.
The Republican attendees of  Trump 's lunch meeting are notable. Cotton has publicly ripped the terms of the Durbin-Graham deal.
Both Cotton and Perdue   Trump  allies in the Senate  also stood up for the president after Durbin said he called African nations ""s---hole"" countries during one of the immigration meetings earlier this month. Graham  on the other hand  did not dispute Durbin's account.

On Saturday  NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell issued a statement saying that comments like the ones  [TGT]  made were ""divisive"" and showed an ""unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL  our great game and all of our players."" Goodell cited NFL players' recent response to Hurricane Harvey as an example of how the NFL can be an ""overwhelming force for good.""
Personally  it seems odd that  [TGT]would chose to discuss anthem protests at a time when there are dozens of far more pressing issues facing the country. There are so many more important things to discuss  yet  [TGT]  went for...that? It's just very strange.

Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan said  Trump  is ""jealous"" of NFL and his attacks are ""personal.""
Adam Shefter said other NFL owners feel  Trump 's attacks are a personal vendetta.
 President Donald Trump  went after the NFL again on Wednesday tweeting  ""The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!""
Now comes multiple reports that NFL owners believe  Trump  is just waging a personal vendetta over not being allowed into the NFL fraternity.
In an interview with Jarrett Bell of USA Today  Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan  described  Trump 's attacks on the NFL as a ""personal issue.""
 Trump  famously went to war with the NFL in the 1980s as an owner in the now-defunct USFL. More recently however   Trump  was one of three bidders for the Buffalo Bills when they were for sale in 2014.  He  was always considered a longshot and eventually lost out to Terry Pegula  who also owns the NHL's Buffalo Sabres.
According to ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter  Khan is not the only owner who feels that way about  Trump .
Schefter said he made calls to ""people in Washington"" who said they did not believe it to be true. However  the owners do believe that  Trump  is angry at the NFL  in general  and Commissioner Roger Goodell  specifically.
""I can tell you that there are other owners who believe that part of the reason that  Trump  is gone after the NFL as aggressively as  he  has is because  he  believes Roger Goodell had a hand in preventing  him  from buying the Buffalo Bills back when they were for sale "" Schefter said. ""And because  he  has not been included in that ownership fraternity   he  is now waging  his  own little vendetta against the NFL.""","[TGT] is still going after the NFL over anthem protests.

4654,In Trump 's bully pulpit it's us vs. them with race often used as a device to polarize,Donald Trump,"For much of his time as president   Donald Trump  has been the bully in the bully pulpit  castigating targets foreign and domestic. Much of  Trump ’s bluster attempts to divide people into us-against-them  and it often has a single polarizing agent: race.
On Friday night  as he has many times before   Trump  inflamed an almost exclusively white Southern audience against opponents who he said were trying to steal their heritage and attack their values. In that Alabama speech and on Saturday  he criticized African American athletes who had exercised free speech by declining to stand during the national anthem.
His racially oriented statements seem to reflect  Trump ’s embrace of the world as it was decades ago when power was largely held by men like him.
By the sheer bulk of his comments   Trump  has reversed what had been a trend in politics over several decades: racial appeals have grown less overt  not more.  Trump’s  targets in the last week  by contrast  have included Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry  unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and ESPN anchor Jemele Hill — all African Americans.
 Trump  jumped into the presidential contest by flinging insults at Mexicans. During  his  campaign   he  cast doubt on the allegiance of Muslims  accused people in China and Japan of taking American jobs  and over and over castigated immigrants.
The point appeared to be to encourage a surge of white pride that would draw voters to  him  — and to a large extent it worked. Now  as president  Trump is continuing in the mold  he  made as a candidate.
Divining the intent of any politician’s remarks  or the audience’s receipt of them  can be complicated. Who doesn’t want America to be great? Who doesn’t want values protected? Not all  Trump  supporters were drawn in by  his  racial views  although by this point  he  has made them clear.
Political messages are refracted through individual lenses  and often unwittingly rely on deep-seated assumptions and biases  according to social scientists. For example   Trump’s  regular calls for an imposition of law and order may seem reasonable to an audience of white supporters fearful of crime and of criminals they presume to be nonwhite. To others in nonwhite communities fearful of law enforcement   Trump’s  words seem to give license to abuse by police. Similar pitches on topics such as welfare  immigration  gay and transgender rights and women’s rights may sound one way to  Trump ’s supporters  and the opposite to others.
The closest comparison to  Trump  in recent decades may be the former Democratic governor of Alabama  George Wallace. In his presidential campaigns  Wallace was stylistically similar to  Trump  in his aggression on the stump; he blamed “anarchists” for disrupting his events and the country at large  much as  Trump  has often impugned today’s protesters. As a renowned segregationist  Wallace didn’t have to talk openly about race; instead he talked about blocking fair housing laws initiated to protect minorities.
“It’s hard to find somebody as bold and blunt as  Trump  is without going back to George Wallace ” said Joe Feagin  a Texas A&M professor who has studied race relations for decades. “It’s more of a megaphone than a dog whistle.”
America has changed since Wallace’s era. Yet  Trump  has found success by both cultivating and reinforcing concerns among many modern-day Americans that the country is changing too swiftly  stripping them of their traditional standing.
In an August NBC News poll  voters were asked if they were comfortable with “different lifestyles  gender roles  languages  cultures and experiences.” Among Hillary Clinton voters  81% said they were comfortable. Only 28% of  Trump  voters said the same. To persuade those voters that he shares their views   Trump  has divided the nation between his people — and the others.","For much of his time as president   Donald Trump  has been the bully in the bully pulpit  castigating targets foreign and domestic.

4655,White House planning major trade announcement Thursday on steel aluminum imports,Donald Trump,"The White House is planning to make a major announcement Thursday about whether it will impose new limits on steel and aluminum imports  three people familiar with the event said  following months of speculation about whether  President Donald Trump  would follow through on trade threats and impose tariffs that could roil global markets.
The announcement is connected to a review of steel and aluminum imports that the Commerce Department conducted at  Trump 's behest. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has found that large amounts of steel and aluminum imports pose a threat to U.S. national security  a declaration that gives the White House powers to limit imports through tariffs or other means.
Philip Levy  senior White House trade economist for President George W. Bush  said  the Trump administration  ""comes off as belligerent"" in the document.
The 359-page report was made public as U.S. officials were in Mexico City for the latest round of talks aimed at renegotiating the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.  Trump  has repeatedly threatened to quit NAFTA unless Mexico and Canada agree to concessions that return lost manufacturing jobs to the United States.
 The administration  took credit for launching ""a new era in American trade policy"" by reversing decades of multilateral trade policies that  it  said had damaged U.S. workers and intensifying enforcement efforts. Over the past 13 months  the Commerce Department has initiated 102 anti-dumping and countervailing-duty investigations  nearly double the prior-year figure.
The report also underscored the mixed messages emanating from the administration on trade  particularly on a Pacific trade deal that  Trump  withdrew the United States from on  his  first working day in the White House.
On Tuesday  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he had engaged in ""high-level"" discussions with foreign counterparts aimed at enabling the United State to rejoin the treaty with Japan and 10 other nations.  Trump  in January said for the first time that  he  might seek to reenter the trade pact that  he  earlier had disparaged.","The White House is planning to make a major announcement Thursday about whether it will impose new limits on steel and aluminum imports  three people familiar with the event said  following months of speculation about whether  President [TGT]  would follow through on trade threats and impose tariffs that could roil global markets.

4658,Las Vegas shooting: Trump calls it 'act of pure evil ' plans to visit,Donald Trump,"Skip in Skip x Embed  x Share CLOSE U.S. President Donald Trump  spoke to the nation Monday morning about the mass shooting in Las Vegas  which left at least 50 people dead and more than 400 injured.  The president  said  ""it was an act of pure evil."" (Oct. 2) AP
On Sunday night  a gunman opened fire from a hotel room above a packed outdoor concert in Las Vegas  an attack that killed at least 50 and wounded at least 400 more. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said  Trump  was briefed early Monday.
It is the first mass killing under  Trump 's watch as his ability to console the nation is already being tested by his administration's response to hurricanes in Texas  Florida and Puerto Rico. A gunman opened fire on a congressional baseball practice in June  but no victims were killed in that incident.
 Trump  is still scheduled to travel Tuesday to Puerto Rico to review hurricane recovery efforts.
 His  response to the Las Vegas tragedy was more focused on sympathy for the victims  in contrast to  his  statements as a candidate in the aftermath of mass shootings.
After a mass shooting at an Oregon community college in 2015   Trump  said that fewer people would have died if more of the victims had their own guns.  He  made the same argument after the Orlando night club shooting a year later  saying it would have minimized the death count if others “had guns strapped to their waists or strapped to their ankle.”
In omitting the incidence of mass shootings in the U.S.   Trump  sent a clear signal  his  administration does not see a link between these incidents and the relative ease with which individuals in the U.S. can obtain high-powered weapons and firearms originally conceived for battlefield use.

 [TGT]  response to the Las Vegas tragedy was more focused on sympathy for the victims  in contrast to  [TGT]  statements as a candidate in the aftermath of mass shootings.
After a mass shooting at an Oregon community college in 2015   [TGT]said that fewer people would have died if more of the victims had their own guns.  He  made the same argument after the Orlando night club shooting a year later  saying it would have minimized the death count if others “had guns strapped to their waists or strapped to their ankle.”
In omitting the incidence of mass shootings in the U.S.   Trump  sent a clear signal  his  administration does not see a link between these incidents and the relative ease with which individuals in the U.S. can obtain high-powered weapons and firearms originally conceived for battlefield use.

4659,Congress Takes on Immigration Issue Amid Election Pressures,Donald Trump,"The Senate begins a rare  open-ended debate on immigration and the fate of the ""Dreamer"" immigrants on Monday  and Republican senators say they'll introduce  President Donald Trump 's plan. Though  his  proposal has no chance of passage   Trump  may be the most influential voice in the conversation.
If the aim is to pass a legislative solution   Trump  will be a crucial and  at times  complicating player.  His  day-to-day turnabouts on the issues have confounded Democrats and Republicans and led some to urge the White House to minimize  his  role in the debate for fear  he 'll say something that undermines the effort.
Yet  his  ultimate support will be vital if Congress is to overcome election-year pressures against compromise. No Senate deal is likely to see the light of day in the more conservative House without the president's blessing and promise to sell compromise to his hard-line base.
Democrats and some Republicans say they want to help the ""Dreamers "" young immigrants who have lived in the U.S. illegally since they were children and have only temporarily been protected from deportation by an Obama-era program.  Trump  has said  he  wants to aid them and has even proposed a path to citizenship for 1.8 million  but in exchange wants $25 billion for  his  proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall plus significant curbs to legal immigration.
Seven GOP senators said late Sunday that they will introduce  Trump 's framework  which they called a reasonable compromise that has White House backing. The group includes Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas  John Cornyn of Texas and Iowa's Charles Grassley.
Democrats adamantly oppose  Trump 's plan  particularly  its  barring of legal immigrants from sponsoring their parents or siblings to live in the U.S. It has no chance of getting the 60 votes needed to survive. The plan will give GOP lawmakers a chance to stake out a position  but it could prove an embarrassment to the White House if some Republicans join Democrats and it's rejected by a substantial margin.
In January   Trump  invited two dozen lawmakers from both parties to the White House in what became a nearly hour-long immigration negotiating session.  He  asked them to craft a ""bill of love"" and said  he 'd sign a solution they'd send  him .
At another White House session days later   he  told Durbin and Graham  he  was rejecting their bipartisan offer.  He  used a profanity to describe African nations and said  he 'd prefer immigrants from Norway  comments that have soured many Democrats about  Trump 's intentions.
 Trump  made a clamp-down on immigration a staple of  his  2016 presidential campaign. As president  he  has mixed expressions of sympathy for Dreamers with rhetoric that equate immigration with crime and drugs.
Last September  he  said  he  was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  or DACA  which lets Dreamers temporarily live and work in the U.S.  Trump  said President Barack Obama had lacked the legal power to create DACA.
 Trump  gave Congress until March 5 to somehow replace  it   though a federal court has forced  him  to continue its protections.","The Senate begins a rare  open-ended debate on immigration and the fate of the ""Dreamer"" immigrants on Monday  and Republican senators say they'll introduce  President Donald Trump 's plan.

4663,Who Will Blink First When Iran Is on the Brink?,Barack Obama,"Obama has also emphasized Tehran's own actions as the determining factor in a U.S. response. ""We offered the Iranian government a clear choice "" he said on July 1  when he signed the Iran Sanctions Act. ""It could fulfill its international obligations and realize greater security  deeper economic and political integration with the world ... or it could continue to flout its responsibilities and face even more pressure and isolation.""
 And a few days later  the president stressed in an interview with Israeli television that although his administration will ""continue to keep the door open for a diplomatic resolution ... I assure you that I have not taken options off the table.""
 As a practical matter  however  Obama's decision on the use of force would hinge on factors well beyond Iran's timetable for obtaining a bomb. In fact  the political  military and policy constraints Obama would face could compel his administration to forgo the military option no matter how close Iran gets to joining the nuclear club.
 First  there is the United Nations to consider. Both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations have centered their responses to Iran's nuclear ambitions on the Security Council  implying that Iran's conduct violates not just U.S. national security interests but also Tehran's international legal obligations. For Obama  the United Nations has doctrinal centrality  as well. According to the president's recently released National Security Strategy  ""When force is necessary ... we will seek broad international support  working with such institutions as NATO and the U.N. Security Council.""
 Obama came into office pledging a new politics of accountability and responsibility  suggesting a predisposition to engage the public on the possibility that the United States may find itself in a prolonged war with a damaged but dangerous adversary. From town halls to college campuses  the president and his advisers would need to connect with civil society  clergy and university students _ not to mention Congress _ on this critical issue.
 Obama would have to decide whether the legitimacy conferred by a last-ditch warning of an attack was worth the sacrifice of tactical advantage. In the end  the balance would probably tip in favor of the moral (rather than operational) considerations  because the spiraling tension and flow of military assets to the gulf would give Tehran all the warning it needed.

4667,Live from Washington: Obama ' s health care summit,Barack Obama,"President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies are pleading their case for health care overhaul in an extraordinary summit with Republicans  broadcast live to a divided public on daytime TV.
 But the public is split over the Democrats' sweeping legislation  with its $1 trillion  10-year price tag and many complex provisions  including some that wouldn't take effect for another eight years -- after Obama has packed up and left the White House.
 For Obama  the summit is his chance to make a compelling closing argument to the American people. If he succeeds  Democrats will push ahead to pass the legislation with a package of revisions he's proposed. If Obama falters  another Democratic president will have been humbled by health care.

4673,NRA Power Hangs Over Efforts to Stem Flow of Weapons to Mexico (Washn),Barack Obama,"The reason? Barack Obama.
Critics say the NRA and other gun organizations used Obama's candidacy and election to scare gun owners and boost their memberships. In TV ads and on the Internet  the NRA warned that Obama planned to ban handguns and close 90 percent of gun shops.
Obama never said anything about banning handguns or closing gun shops. His campaign platform promised to pursue long-standing proposals to address urban violence: reinstating the assault weapons ban  outlawing ""cop killer"" bullets and closing the ""gun-show loophole"" that permits firearm sales without background checks.
The campaign said Obama favored ""commonsense measures"" to protect gun rights ""while keeping guns away from children and from criminals who shouldn't have them."" Obama also said he would repeal the Tiahrt Amendment.
The NRA created a Web page that is still active  www.gunbanobama.com  to attack Obama's gun record. The site states  ""Hillary was Right: You Can't Trust Obama With Your Guns."" It then links to a mailer that Hillary Rodham Clinton used in the Democratic primary against Obama.
Recognizing his vulnerability in swing states  Obama began to run an alternate campaign to calm the worries of gun owners  said Ray Schoenke  a former Washington Redskins lineman who founded a moderate gun rights group  the American Hunters and Shooters Association  as part of the Obama effort.
The Obama campaign paid for Schoenke's travel to 40 events in Ohio  Pennsylvania  Florida and Colorado to address pro-gun voters.
""The opposition said Obama was going to take away everyone's guns  tax ammunitions  tax guns  register guns and reinstate the assault weapons ban "" Schoenke said. ""We said  'He is not going to do any of these things.' And he didn't.""
When Holder  then Obama's nominee for attorney general  repeated Obama's gun control platform at his confirmation hearing last year  65 Democrats wrote Holder vowing to ""actively oppose"" any effort to restore the assault weapons ban. It was taken off the table  along with the other proposals.
Schoenke said he was in touch with the White House after Holder's comments  and he was assured that Obama would not be making a move toward stricter gun laws unpopular with gun groups. ""We basically said it ain't gonna happen "" Schoenke said recently. ""And it hasn't happened.""
In his first 20 months in office  Obama has virtually been silent on guns.
When the Obama administration passed its budget last year  it left the Tiahrt Amendment virtually intact. It expanded police access to the gun trace data but tightened restrictions on public disclosure of the data.
""President Obama's first-year record on gun violence prevention has been an abject failure "" said the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
""We're up against  in the next two years  an Obama administration embedded with people that have spent a lifetime trying to destroy this great American freedom "" LaPierre said on an NRA election-night webcast  ""and we're going to have our work cut out for us.""","The reason? [TGT].

4674,Obama Republicans reach deal to extend tax cuts,Barack Obama,"Brushing past opposition in his own party  President Barack Obama announced agreement with Republicans Monday night on a plan to extend expiring income tax cuts for all Americans  renew jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and grant a one-year reduction in payroll taxes.
 own party  President Barack Obama announced agreement with Republicans Monday night on a plan to extend expiring income tax cuts for all Americans  renew jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and grant a one-year reduction in payroll taxes.
 The emerging agreement also includes tax breaks for businesses that the president said would contribute to the economy's recovery from the worst recession in eight decades.
 Obama's announcement marked a dramatic reversal of his long-held insistence  originally laid out in his 2008 campaign  that tax cuts should only be extended at incomes up to $200 000 for individuals and $250 000 for couples. He explained his about-face by saying that he still opposed the move and noted the agreement called for a temporary  two-year extension of cuts at all income levels  not the permanent renewal that Republicans have long sought.
 Obama also wanted to wrap up a deal on the tax cuts quickly to leave time for the Senate to debate and vote on a new nuclear arms control treaty with Russia  which the president has made a top year-end priority.
 Both parties have been under pressure from their bases not to compromise on the tax cut issue. Republicans insist that it makes no sense to raise taxes on anyone in a weak economy. Democrats argue that extending tax cuts for the richest Americans would contribute to rising deficits and force deeper cuts in social welfare programs. Obama found himself under fire from liberal Democrats who accused him of being too quick to cave in to Republican demands.
 Obama said the continued political stalemate over taxes amounted to a ""chilling prospect for the American people whose taxes are currently scheduled to go up on Jan. 1.""
 Obama said there were elements of the deal he personally opposed  including an extension of expiring income tax cuts at upper income levels and the more generous deal on estate taxes. But he said he decided that an agreement with Republicans was more important than a stalemate that would have resulted in higher income taxes at all levels on Jan. 1.
 Even though the newly elected lawmakers don't take their seats until January  Obama has already treated Republican leaders with far more deference than he has so far in his term. Similarly  McConnell and Rep. John Boehner of Ohio  in line to become House speaker  have seemed willing to strive for compromise with the White House  rather than merely oppose virtually all of the president's initiatives.","Brushing past opposition in his own party  [TGT] announced agreement with Republicans Monday night on a plan to extend expiring income tax cuts for all Americans  renew jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed and grant a one-year reduction in payroll taxes.

4675,Obama concedes problems with health overhaul,Barack Obama,"Obama acknowledged  however  that the effort had run into a ""bit of a buzz saw"" of opposition. And a leading member of his party suggested Congress slow it down on health care  a sign of eroding political will in the wake of Tuesday's Republican election upset in Massachusetts.
 Obama put fixing a broken health care system at the of his 2008 campaign for the presidency  and once elected made it the top priority of his first term. He has faced solid opposition from the Republican minority  which has rolled over into his fellow Democrats in Congress and to growing numbers of voters.
 Despite assurances from Obama and his administration  opposition to his plans have grown among people who bought into allegations of higher taxes  unbearable government deficits and serious government meddling in health care.
 Obama has spoken about the patchwork nature of the U.S. health care system but said it is politically impossible to throw out the system and start from scratch. Thus the two bills passed by the Senate and House  which under normal congressional rules must be negotiated into a joint bill and re-passed by both chambers.
 Just a week ago the health legislation had appeared on the cusp of passage after Obama threw himself into marathon negotiations with congressional leaders to work out differences between the House and Senate bills.
 ""There are things that have to get done. This is our best chance to do it. We can't keep on putting this off "" Obama said Friday at a town hall meeting in Elyria  Ohio  warning listeners that spiraling medical costs threaten to bankrupt them and the country unless Congress acts.
 ""I am not going to walk away just because it's hard "" the president said.
 In his remarks  Obama seemed to pull back from a suggestion he made on Wednesday that lawmakers unite behind the elements of the legislation everyone can agree on. Obama said that approach presented problems because some of the popular ideas  like new requirements on insurance companies  could not be done without getting many more people insured. That  he said  requires giving everybody access to coverage.
 Obama has used immense political capital to advance the health care overhaul and remake a system that has frustrated past administrations  most recently Democrat Bill Clinton in 1994. Whether he can succeed where others have failed is now anything but clear  and Obama seemed to acknowledge as much.
 ""Here's the good news. We've gotten pretty far down the road  but I have to admit  we had a little bit of a buzz saw this week "" the president said.
 ""I understand that  why after the Massachusetts election people in Washington were all in a tizzy  trying to figure out what this means for health reform  Republicans and Democrats: What does it mean for Obama? Is he weakened? Is he  oh  how's he going to survive this?"" Obama said. ""But I want you to understand  this is not about me. This is about you.""

Thus the two bills passed by the Senate and House  which under normal congressional rules must be negotiated into a joint bill and re-passed by both chambers.
 Just a week ago the health legislation had appeared on the cusp of passage after [TGT] threw [TGT] into marathon negotiations with congressional leaders to work out differences between the House and Senate bills.
 ""There are things that have to get done. This is our best chance to do it. We can't keep on putting this off [TGT] said Friday at a town hall meeting in Elyria  Ohio  warning listeners that spiraling medical costs threaten to bankrupt them and the country unless Congress acts.
 ""I am not going to walk away just because it's hard "" [TGT] said.
 In [TGT] remarks  [TGT] seemed to pull back from a suggestion [TGT] made on Wednesday that lawmakers unite behind the elements of the legislation everyone can agree on. [TGT] said that approach presented problems because some of the popular ideas  like new requirements on insurance companies  could not be done without getting many more people insured. That  [TGT] said  requires giving everybody access to coverage.
 [TGT] has used immense political capital to advance the health care overhaul and remake a system that has frustrated past administrations  most recently Democrat Bill Clinton in 1994. Whether he can succeed where others have failed is now anything but clear  and [TGT] seemed to acknowledge as much.
 ""Here's the good news. We've gotten pretty far down the road  but I have to admit  we had a little bit of a buzz saw this week "" the president said.
 ""I understand that  why after the Massachusetts election people in Washington were all in a tizzy  trying to figure out what this means for health reform  Republicans and Democrats: What does it mean for [TGT]? Is [TGT] weakened? Is [TGT]  oh  how's [TGT] going to survive this?"" [TGT] said. ""But I want you to understand  this is not about [TGT]. This is about you.""

President Barack Obama said Wednesday  as the world's biggest economy combats its worst slump in decades.
 ""It's true that we've stopped the freefall. The market is up and the financial system is no longer on the verge of collapse "" Obama said. ""So  we may be seeing the beginning of the end of the recession.""
 Speaking at a town hall in North Carolina  where unemployment is around 10 percent  Obama cautioned: ""that's little comfort if you're one of the folks who have lost their job and haven't found another.""
 He also questioned the cover of the current edition of Newsweek magazine  which pronounced that ""The Recession is Over.""
 ""I bet you found that news a little startling. I know I did "" Obama said.
 The United States is now losing jobs ""at nearly half"" the rate of when he took office in January  he added in defending his plans to stimulate the economy.

“But I think that begs the question ”  he  continued. “I think we focused on places we thought were  that were in contest  and at the end of the day we fell short in those states and I think that this active measures effort by the Russians could have tilted the election in Donald Trump’s favor.”
“But I think what the real issue is how  he  has reacted to it ”  he  claimed. “And in that context  if this is information warfare then I think  he ’s the first draft-dodger in the war.”

4678,So Much For Obama 's Pledge To Transparency,Barack Obama,"President Barack Obama  repeatedly pledged  he  would run the most transparent administration in the history of the United States during both of  his  presidential campaigns  but the evidence shows  Obama ’s administration has not only failed to meet that standard  it has actively worked to conceal important information from the public.
For instance  in March 2015  the  Obama  administration rescinded a regulation requiring the administration to comply with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests  thereby exempting itself from public scrutiny and oversight. So much for transparency.
The  Obama  administration’s action should not surprise anyone. An Associated Press investigation conducted in 2014 shows secrecy has increased dramatically under  Obama ’s time in office. In 2013  the  Obama  administration censored or denied 244 675 FOIA requests  which amounts to about 36% of the FOIA applications the administration received. This rejection rate is higher than under any previous presidential administration. Another 196 034 FOIA requests were denied because the government claimed it couldn’t find records or the government determined the request to be unreasonable or improper. In 2014  the figures were even worse. More than 250 000  or about 39%  of FOIA requests were either censored or denied. In 215 584 other instances  the government said the records could not be found or it decided the requests were unreasonable.
Memos and information related to national security deserve heightened scrutiny before being released—if they are released at all—but the  Obama  administration has concealed or denied the release of critical information not related to national security as well  such as the scientific information used to justify environmental regulations.  Obama ’s lack of transparency when  it  comes to environmental science makes it very difficult for independent researchers to review important data the government relies on to ensure environmental regulations are justified and based on sound science.
Multiple U.S. Senate reports have found  Obama  administration officials at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other government environmental agencies have repeatedly attempted to avoid public input at meetings or have worked to limit scrutiny by hiding information that ought to have been made readily available  violating the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)  widely known as the “open meetings law.”","[TGT]repeatedly pledged  [TGT]  would run the most transparent administration in the history of the United States during both of  [TGT]  presidential campaigns  but the evidence shows  [TGT] ’s administration has not only failed to meet that standard  it has actively worked to conceal important information from the public.

4679,Delusional Obama Did Not Have a Scandal,Barack Obama,"Upon hearing that  former President Barack Obama  recently boasted that  he  had a scandal-free administration  my first thought after regaining my faculties was: How can I possibly cram all the evidence refuting this in a little bitty column?
Then I read that what  he  actually said was  ""We didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us."" At first blush  that sounds better  right? Because I assume  he  doesn't mean  he 's incapable of being embarrassed. After a little more thought  though  it occurred to me that this construction just highlights the real reason  he  has apparently deluded  himself  into thinking  he  served eight honorable years: The liberal media had  his  back the entire time  even when  he  treated them like dirt.
In fact   Obama  was a perpetual power-abusing machine.  He  was so routinely high-handed and selectively contemptuous of the rule of law that people were beginning to think presidential authoritarianism was the new normal. How ironic that so many of  Obama 's enablers are now projecting these sins onto President Trump  who — to this point  at least - hasn't actually crossed the line into flouting the Constitution. The left believes — and acts on the belief — that the ends justify the means  and so  it naturally assumes we will do the same.  Obama  was hell-bent on fundamentally transforming America as founded  and  he  was willing to scratch  bite  kick  steal and flush the rule of law to accomplish it — and  he  did  like no president before  him . In other words   Obama 's lies were OK because lies are sometimes necessary for the greater good.
For your review  let me just give you a list of examples  many of them snatched from my two  Obama  books  which chronicled his two disgraceful terms. Not all technically qualify as scandals  but enough do.
— Benghazi: In addition to the scandalous betrayal and death of our people   Obama  and  his  cohorts concocted and disseminated the lie that the attack on our consulate was caused by an anti-Muslim video. Later  Judicial Watch obtained a smoking-gun email from top-level  Obama  aid Ben Rhodes  sent to a dozen members of  Obama 's inner circle  that contained talking points to prepare then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice for the Sunday talk shows. Three of the four main bullet points Rhodes was advising Rice to convey were patently false  including the lie about the video. They knew  because the CIA made it clear  that the attack was not the result of a spontaneous protest to an anti-Muslim video but preplanned by al-Qaida. The  Obama  administration manufactured this canard to insulate  Obama  from criticism two months before the November 2012 election  as he had boasted that he had al-Qaida on the run.
—  Obama 's IRS conspired to target conservative and pro-Israel groups for discriminatory treatment in acquiring tax exemptions.
—  Obama  and then-Attorney general Eric Holder's Justice Department was never held to account for its actions on the gunrunning scandal known as Operation Fast and Furious  in which an American was murdered with weapons this administration deliberately put into the hands of Mexican cartels.
— The  Obama  administration flagrantly defied a federal court order on his moratorium on offshore drilling when his interior secretary  Ken Salazar  said he would just reimpose the moratorium based on information that wasn't fully developed earlier.
—  Obama  rigged the playing field to secure for  his  labor-union friends a bigger stake in  his  new General Motors than was warranted by their actual ownership interest.  He  robbed secured creditors of their preferred-creditor status and the value of their investment by using the power of  his  office to strong-arm a restructuring of the company. When Democratic Party donor and super-lawyer Tom Lauria opposed this plan on behalf of his client  according to Lauria  the White House threatened to destroy his client's reputation.
— Then  there's the Iran nuclear deal   Obama 's unprecedented federal land grabs;  his  dismissal of a voter-intimidation case against the New Black Panther Party that had already been won;  his  bullying of doctors and insurance companies when it served  his  purposes;  his  endless stirring of the racial pot;  his  bullying and fact-starved attack on BP that culminated in  his  authoritarian command  ""Just plug the damn hole"";  his  stable of unaccountable ""czars"";  his  war on Fox News  which preceded Trump's battles with the press that Democrats find so horrifying; the Department of Veterans Affairs scandal; the Solyndra scandal; the deliberate targeting of the coal industry; the shakedown of banks; the massive redistribution scheme disguised as an economic stimulus program; the federal commandeering of the student loan program; his public dressing down of the Supreme Court; his whispered hot-mic pledge to Russia to be more flexible on missile defense; his cavalier treatment of Arizona and its immigration laws; and gobs more.","Upon hearing that  [TGT]recently boasted that  [TGT]  had a scandal-free administration  my first thought after regaining my faculties was: How can I possibly cram all the evidence refuting this in a little bitty column?

It will move more and more to the forefront once there 's a new president dealing with the 247 reality show that is the White House and Obama settles into the more non-partisan , ceremonial role his surviving predecessors occupy today . 
""Progress on this journey often comes in small increments , sometimes two steps forward , one step back , propelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens ,"" as Obama put it in his response to the Supreme Court 's same sex marriage ruling Friday . 
Obama 's election as the first black president -- powered by landslide margins with black and Latino voters and historic turnout by younger voters -- was hailed as a historic moment , but it was eclipsed almost immediately by the massive challenges that landed on his desk and the intense backlash his policy responses provoked on the right . 
In politics , it 's often discussed as a matter of partisan scorekeeping , as it was after Obama 's two elections .

4681,"Obama 's Last , Hopeful State of the Union . ",Barack Obama,"""Let me tell you something ,"" President Barack Obama said in his final State of the Union address , on Tuesday night . 
The audience , made up of Congress and other government officials and their guests , was applauding , but Obama kept going . 
But Obama , it seems , has had enough of hearing about how he has , in Donald Trump 's words , ""crippled"" America . 
And we are great at home : ""The United States of America , right now , has the strongest , most durable economy in the world ,"" Obama said . 
At times , and in a narrower sense , it has included Obama himself , who spent less time than he might have last night on hard economic issues like inequality . 
Because this was his last State of the Union , the White House had suggested that Obama would be less constrained , and , in terms of the format , he was . 
This State of the Union was not a list of items that the Administration would send to Congress or otherwise pursue -- ""do n't worry , I 've got plenty ,"" Obama said , before offering a rushed statement on immigration , gun violence , and the minimum wage . 
Sitting with Michelle Obama , who stood out in a bright saffron Narciso Rodriguez dress -LRB- ""marigold ,"" according to the designer -RRB- , there was , as always , a slate of guests whose presence made various points -LRB- James Obergefell , the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court 's marriage-equality case ; Spencer Stone , who tackled a terrorist on a French train ; an empty seat for a victim of gun violence -RRB- , but Obama left it to the press to tell their stories , rather than working them into his speech . 
Perhaps we needed to hear it ; perhaps Obama himself did , too . 
Among the Republicans running to replace him , it is a truism that Obama is weak -- ""weak and uncertain"" -LRB- Jeb Bush -RRB- , a ""feckless weakling"" -LRB- Chris Christie -RRB- , whose ""unbelievable weakness"" -LRB- Ted Cruz -RRB- has ""deliberately weakened America ."" 
And yet , Obama said , ""Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office ."" 
A few terrorists could do a lot of harm , Obama said , ""But , as we focus on destroying ISIL , over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands ."" 
Dealing with such groups , Obama said , would require ""more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians ."" 
In the end , though , Obama said , ""when it comes to every important international issue , people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead . 
Obama is not known as the most social of Washingtonians , and yet sociability was the great theme of his speech . 
Speaking to the assembled senators and representatives , Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court Justices -LRB- six , anyway -- Antonin Scalia , Samuel Alito , and Clarence Thomas stayed home -RRB- , and guests , Obama seemed to want to make it clear that he was n't the lonesome one in the room . 
""Sixty years ago , when the Russians beat us into space , we did n't deny Sputnik was up there ,"" Obama said ; we just went to the moon . 
Vice-President Joseph Biden had raised the idea of another moon shot to cure cancer after the death of his son , Beau , from the disease last year , and Obama announced that there would be ""a new national effort"" to get it done and that , ""because he 's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past forty years , I 'm putting Joe in charge of mission control ."" 
Progress is a choice in the way that friendship is a choice , Obama suggested . 
Obama acknowledged that , in the strongest part of his speech . 
Redistricting , campaign-finance reform , and better voter access would help , but Obama was asking , most of all , that people not only vote but be part of public life , and add their voices to the conversation . 
Clear-eyed , big-hearted , undaunted by challenge , optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word ,"" Obama said . 
Obama tried , in his speech , to illustrate something that has , so far , eluded the candidates running to succeed him : how to talk back to Donald Trump without sounding petty , scared , resentful , or otherwise miserable .","""Let me tell you something ,"" [TGT] said in [TGT] final State of the Union address , on Tuesday night .

Sitting with Michelle Obama , who stood out in a bright saffron Narciso Rodriguez dress -LRB- ""marigold ,"" according to the designer -RRB- , there was , as always , a slate of guests whose presence made various points -LRB- James Obergefell , the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court 's marriage-equality case ; Spencer Stone , who tackled a terrorist on a French train ; an empty seat for a victim of gun violence -RRB- , but [TGT] left it to the press to tell their stories , rather than working them into his speech .

Among the Republicans running to replace [TGT] , it is a truism that [TGT] is weak -- ""weak and uncertain"" -LRB- Jeb Bush -RRB- , a ""feckless weakling"" -LRB- Chris Christie -RRB- , whose ""unbelievable weakness"" -LRB- Ted Cruz -RRB- has ""deliberately weakened America ."" 
And yet , [TGT] said , ""Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office ."" 
A few terrorists could do a lot of harm , [TGT] said , ""But , as we focus on destroying ISIL , over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands ."" 
Dealing with such groups , [TGT] said , would require ""more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians ."" 
In the end , though , [TGT] said , ""when it comes to every important international issue , people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead . 
[TGT] is not known as the most social of Washingtonians , and yet sociability was the great theme of [TGT] speech . 
Speaking to the assembled senators and representatives , Cabinet secretaries , Supreme Court Justices -LRB- six , anyway -- Antonin Scalia , Samuel Alito , and Clarence Thomas stayed home -RRB- , and guests , [TGT] seemed to want to make it clear that he was n't the lonesome one in the room . 
""Sixty years ago , when the Russians beat us into space , we did n't deny Sputnik was up there ,"" [TGT] said ; we just went to the moon . 
Vice-President Joseph Biden had raised the idea of another moon shot to cure cancer after the death of his son , Beau , from the disease last year , and [TGT] announced that there would be ""a new national effort"" to get it done and that , ""because he 's gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past forty years , I 'm putting Joe in charge of mission control ."" 
Progress is a choice in the way that friendship is a choice , [TGT] suggested . 
[TGT] acknowledged that , in the strongest part of [TGT] speech . 
Redistricting , campaign-finance reform , and better voter access would help , but [TGT] was asking , most of all , that people not only vote but be part of public life , and add their voices to the conversation . 
Clear-eyed , big-hearted , undaunted by challenge , optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word ,"" [TGT] said . 
[TGT] tried , in [TGT] speech , to illustrate something that has , so far , eluded the candidates running to succeed [TGT] : how to talk back to Donald Trump without sounding petty , scared , resentful , or otherwise miserable .",Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4682,Sean Hannity : Obama farewell ca n't hide a disastrous legacy . ,Barack Obama,"""No matter how we reform health care , we will keep this promise to the American people ,"" Obama said on June 15 , 2009 . 
President Obama spent much of Tuesday 's farewell address boasting about his success , but the facts paint a much different picture .

The next year , just hours before the horrific ISIS attack in Paris that killed 130 people , Obama assured us that ISIS was ""contained ."" 
In fact , it seized vast parts of Iraq because Obama created a vacuum when he pulled U.S. troops out too early for purely political reasons . 
Remember when Obama repeatedly told you that under his plan you could keep your doctor , you keep your plan and that that it would drive down overall health costs to the point the average family would save $ 2,500 a year ? 
In Egypt , Obama he gave Mohammed Morsi , the former Muslim Brotherhood head who became president but is now in prison for murder , F-16s , tanks and $ 1.5 billion in taxpayer funds . 
There 's no doubt President Obama 's legacy is one of severe damage to the country . 
And by the time he leaves office , President Obama will have added more to our national debt that all the other presidents before him combined . 
Then , of course , there 's President Obama 's assault on the business community through his burdensome regulations . 
Consider this : The estimated cost of regulations under Obama is a staggering $ 873 billion . 
When President Obama finally leaves office , the national debt will be almost $ 20 trillion . 
When it comes to jobs , President Obama is always bragging about how many he 's created , but facts are stubborn things . 
Obama gave Iran , the No. 1 state sponsor of terror , $ 150 billion and allows them to continue to spin their centrifuges ? 
Obama drew a ""red line"" when he warned Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad not to use chemical weapons .

WASHINGTON , DC - MAY 11 : U.S. President Barack Obama pauses as he speaks during an event to recognize emerging global entrepreneurs May 11 , 2015 at the South Court Auditorium of Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington , DC . 
But in foreign policy Obama 's record was mostly one of failure . 
I began writing this column -LRB- originally in the form of a blog -RRB- in 2009 , at the very beginning of Barack Obama 's presidency . 
And if they do , Obama 's presidency , despite the missteps and missed opportunities , will seem like an era of honor and decency that Americans willfully cast aside and may never fully regain . 
Here one must begin by recalling the dire circumstances when Obama took office . 
Moreover , Obama managed these important economic and social achievements in the face of extraordinary opposition from the Republican Party , which seemed more interested in thwarting Obama than in doing anything to help the American people . 
Barack Obama is an intelligent , disciplined , eloquent , upright , patriotic , and wholly admirable man , and in many ways he was an inspirational presidentBarack Obama is an intelligent , disciplined , eloquent , upright , patriotic , and wholly admirable man , and in many ways he was an inspirational president . 
In foreign policy , the Obama administration successfully negotiated a deal that halted Iran 's progress toward a nuclear weapon . 
And throughout his presidency , Obama conducted himself with the same dignity , humor , grace , intelligence , forbearance , respect for American values and traditions , and above all class that were on display in his farewell speech . 
Contrast that with the tone of Donald Trump 's first post-election press conference , held the day after Obama 's speech , which was bombastic , deceptive , abusive , defiant , contemptuous of traditional norms -- and entirely consistent with Trump 's campaign and business career . 
No matter how petty or two-faced his opponents were , Obama rarely paid them back in kind . 
Yet Obama 's presidency is in other respects a tragedy -- and especially when it comes to foreign policy.Yet Obama 's presidency is in other respects a tragedy -- and especially when it comes to foreign policy . 
It is a tragedy because Obama had the opportunity to refashion America 's role in the world , and at times he seemed to want to do just that . 
The crisis of 2008-2009 was the ideal moment to abandon the failed strategy of liberal hegemony that the United States had been pursuing since the end of the Cold War , but in the end Obama never broke with that familiar but failed approach . 
For starters , Obama was persuaded to escalate the war in Afghanistan in 2009 , in a pointless ""surge"" that was doomed to fail and did . 
Second , Obama and his team misread and mishandled the Arab Spring . 
In particular , Obama and his team mistakenly viewed the Arab Spring as a large-scale , grass-roots uprising clamoring for liberal democracy and embraced it too quickly . 
These misunderstandings led to Obama 's disastrous intervention in Libya , his inept diplomatic interference in Yemen , and the premature demand that ""Assad must go"" in Syria . 
As regular readers know , I think Obama made the right call when he decided not to wade deeper into the Syrian quagmire , but his handling of this admittedly turbulent and difficult-to-read process can hardly be considered a success . 
Regarding Israel-Palestine , Obama took office vowing to achieve a two-state solution by the end of his first term , and he and his second-term secretary of state , John Kerry , devoted endless hours to this quixotic quest . 
A two-state solution is further away than ever and probably impossible , in part because Obama never seemed to grasp that relying on pro-Israel advisors with a long track record of not producing an agreement was a pretty good way to guarantee failure again . 
Nor did Obama and Kerry ever realize that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was not interested in a genuine two-state solution and that Israel was never going to cut a deal unless the United States made it clear that failing to do so would lead to dramatic reductions in U.S. military aid and diplomatic protection . 
Obama 's offer of ever larger bribes of U.S. military aid proved inadequate to the task , as Netanyahu quite sensibly pocketed the offer and dug in his heels , even flying to Washington to dis the president in public . 
I understand why Obama felt he had to tolerate this sort of abuse from a dependent client state -LRB- after all , I wrote a book about it -RRB- , but if he was unwilling to play hardball , he should n't have promised to deliver a solution and should n't have wasted any time or energy on it . 
Obama 's handling of Russia deserves no plaudits either . 
The early attempt at a ""reset"" made sense , but Obama and his advisors never understood that what they regarded as innocent and legitimate efforts to strengthen democracy in Eastern Europe or in Russia itself were not going to be viewed as benign by Moscow . 
Moscow 's actions are regrettable on many levels , but Obama and the people in charge of U.S. policy in Eastern Europe should not have been surprised . 
Obama 's desire to ""rebalance"" U.S. attention toward Asia was sound , and his administration did make important progress toward that goal . 
To a large extent , Obama never made that choice . 
First , although Obama took office intending to re-engineer America 's relationship with the world , he was quickly co-opted by the existing national security establishment and bought into its mantra that the United States as the ""indispensable power"" must take the lead in promoting a rules-based world order centered on free markets , democracy , and human rights . 
Here Obama did face a real dilemma : The Democratic Party 's foreign-policy apparatus was dominated by dedicated liberal crusaders , which meant there was hardly anyone Obama could appoint who agreed wholeheartedly with his foreign-policy instincts . 
Like Bill Clinton , Obama tried to address a vast array of global problems as cheaply as possible -LRB- and without ""boots on the ground"" -RRB- , but he never told the American people what their vital interests actually were . 
""He who defends everything defends nothing ,"" warned Frederick the Great , and Obama 's inability to develop a clear set of strategic priorities hurt him throughout his presidency . 
Second , in both domestic and foreign policy , Obama failed to appreciate that his opponents were not as reasonable , rational , cool , or unselfish as he was . 
If a central theme runs through Obama 's approach to politics , it is his conviction that people with differing views can come together , discuss , debate , share information , and gradually come to a mutual understanding that satisfies both sides and that will advance the public interest . 
When dealing with Netanyahu , for example , Obama -LRB- and Kerry -RRB- thought it obvious that ""two states for two peoples"" was in Israel 's interest and that Netanyahu could be persuaded to see this once he was assured of continued U.S. support . 
In Putin , Obama saw the leader of a declining power whose best course was to liberalize further and reform the lagging Russian economy .","Back at home , [TGT] seemed to think that [TGT] could win over Republicans by reaching out to them -- as [TGT] did when [TGT] nominated a highly qualified and decidedly moderate candidate for the Supreme Court -- never quite realizing that John Boehner , Paul Ryan , Mitch McConnell , Ted Cruz , and the entire tea party cared more about [TGT] failing than they did about America succeeding .

WASHINGTON , DC - MAY 11 : [TGT] pauses as [TGT] speaks during an event to recognize emerging global entrepreneurs May 11 , 2015 at the South Court Auditorium of Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington , DC . 
But in foreign policy [TGT] 's record was mostly one of failure . 
I began writing this column -LRB- originally in the form of a blog -RRB- in 2009 , at the very beginning of [TGT] 's presidency . 
And if they do , [TGT] 's presidency , despite the missteps and missed opportunities , will seem like an era of honor and decency that Americans willfully cast aside and may never fully regain . 
Here one must begin by recalling the dire circumstances when [TGT] took office . 
Moreover , [TGT] managed these important economic and social achievements in the face of extraordinary opposition from the Republican Party , which seemed more interested in thwarting [TGT] than in doing anything to help the American people . 
[TGT] is an intelligent , disciplined , eloquent , upright , patriotic , and wholly admirable man , and in many ways [TGT] was [TGT] is an intelligent , disciplined , eloquent , upright , patriotic , and wholly admirable man , and in many ways [TGT] was an inspirational president . 
In foreign policy , the [TGT] administration successfully negotiated a deal that halted Iran 's progress toward a nuclear weapon . 
And throughout [TGT] presidency , [TGT] conducted [TGT] with the same dignity , humor , grace , intelligence , forbearance , respect for American values and traditions , and above all class that were on display in [TGT] farewell speech . 
Contrast that with the tone of Donald Trump 's first post-election press conference , held the day after [TGT] 's speech , which was bombastic , deceptive , abusive , defiant , contemptuous of traditional norms -- and entirely consistent with Trump 's campaign and business career . 
No matter how petty or two-faced his opponents were , [TGT] rarely paid them back in kind . 
Yet [TGT] 's presidency is in other respects a tragedy -- and especially when it comes to foreign policy.Yet [TGT] 's presidency is in other respects a tragedy -- and especially when it comes to foreign policy . 
It is a tragedy because [TGT] had the opportunity to refashion America 's role in the world , and at times he seemed to want to do just that . 
The crisis of 2008-2009 was the ideal moment to abandon the failed strategy of liberal hegemony that the United States had been pursuing since the end of the Cold War , but in the end [TGT] never broke with that familiar but failed approach . 
For starters , [TGT] was persuaded to escalate the war in Afghanistan in 2009 , in a pointless ""surge"" that was doomed to fail and did . 
Second , [TGT] and [TGT] team misread and mishandled the Arab Spring .

If such a scenario is possible , Democrats might want to tread cautiously , because recently revealed information about the FBI 's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation suggests President Barack Obama 's administration may have also ""obstructed justice"" -- or , at the very least , had a very strong incentive to do so . 
In the draft , Comey mentions that President Obama had communicated with Clinton while she served as secretary of state and ""was on the territory of ... an adversary"" : . 
By the time the July 5 statement was issued letting Clinton off the hook , any mention of emails made by Obama to Clinton 's un-secure email account had been removed from Comey 's statement , which is extremely fortunate for Obama , because if he did knowingly discuss classified information with Clinton through unsecured emails , he could also be investigated for violating federal laws forbidding such reckless activity . 
And there 's evidence Obama may have attempted to cover his tracks by having his e-mails sealed under the guise of executive privilege . 
""Obama had his email communications with Clinton sealed . 
With the media content to play along , this had a twofold benefit : Obama was able -LRB- 1 -RRB- to sidestep disclosure without acknowledging that the emails contained classified information and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to avoid using the term ` executive privilege ' -- with all its dark Watergate connotations -- even though that was precisely what he was invoking ."" 
Obama 's emails were sealed not long after he told CBS News in 2015 he found out about Clinton 's private email server at the ""same time everybody else learned it through news reports ."" 
This is important because emails produced by WikiLeaks show top Democrats and members of Obama 's team reacted in a panic to the former president 's false statement . 
-LRB- Remember , we know Obama had personally emailed Clinton 's private email address . -RRB- 
Cheryl Mills , one of Clinton 's top lawyers told John Podesta , ""we need to clean this up -- he -LSB- Obama -RSB- has emails from her -LSB- Clinton -RSB- - they do not say state.gov ."" 
With all these pieces in place , it 's easy to see why Obama would n't want Clinton to be prosecuted for illegally using a private email server . 
Obama said in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday"" in April 2016 , in the midst of the FBI 's Clinton investigation , he did n't think the allegations against Clinton were nearly as serious as everyone else did . 
""I continue to believe she has not jeopardized America 's national security ,"" Obama said . 
Then , Obama went on the campaign trail for Clinton , serving as another signal that he did n't think Clinton ""jeopardized America 's national security ."" 
Of course , just because President Obama wanted Clinton to be cleared does n't necessarily mean he acted -LRB- and thus ""obstructed justice"" -RRB- to ensure that would happen , but there is much evidence to suggest Comey and his team made up their mind about Clinton long before the investigation was finished . 
-LRB- 3 -RRB- If Clinton had been found guilty of mishandling classified information -LRB- or even simply charged -RRB- , President Obama might have also faced intense scrutiny , and possibly an investigation of his own , because Obama also emailed Clinton on her private server . 
-LRB- 4 -RRB- It appears President Obama deliberately tried to use executive privilege to conceal the fact that he had communicated with Clinton via her private email server , which could be a crime if classified information had been exchanged . 
If those emails did n't contain important information , why did Obama 's team work so hard to keep them from the public ? 
If all these statements are true -- and that appears to be the case , in my opinion -- then the only ""obstruction"" element missing is an actual request by President Obama 's administration -LRB- which , remember , ran the Justice Department -RRB- for Comey to keep Clinton out of trouble . 
However , if liberals continue to suggest Trump is guilty of such a crime for firing Comey while he was investigating alleged collusion , then they could end up putting President Obama -- who we now know had plenty of good , selfish reasons for ending the Clinton email investigation -- in an exceptionally difficult situation .","Did Barack Obama ` Obstruct Justice ' in Clinton Email Case ?

Whether he 's in the White House or not , Barack Obama continues to make a strong impact on our nation . 
Obama was invited to speak at Bill and Melinda Gates ' charity foundation on Wednesday , Sept. 20 , and naturally , it was another opportunity for him to bestow his wisdom upon us . 
Obama could probably recite his grocery list and it 'd be moving . 
We can get tired and overwhelmed when our work does n't bring results , but Obama assured us -- and his girls -- that change takes time . 
In addition to making headlines for his one of many powerful speeches , Obama has also condemned the GOP healthcare bill , saying it will inflict ""real human suffering"" if it 's passed ; he has warned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take the fake news threats seriously ; and he has also helped our country 's youngsters by talking to them about the benefits of coding . 
As the girls ' responsibilities continue to grow , Obama and his wife try to emphasize to their teens that being considerate and hardworking is an important undertaking , that they 're necessary traits . 
""These are the tools by which you can shape the world around you in a way that feels good ,"" Obama said , according to People . 
Obama broke down the proposal scenario to his staffers with two very simple questions : . 
Obama has focused his political career on helping others -- and dedicated his campaigns to change -- so it 's only natural that he taught his daughters to do the same .

4727,"At home and abroad , Obama 's trail of disasters . ",Barack Obama,"NEW YORK , NY - SEPTEMBER 23 : U.S. President Barack Obama , who is in New York City for the 69th Session of the United Nations General Assembly , speaks at the Clinton Global Initiative on September 23 , 2014 in New York City . 
AS HE PREPARES to move out of the White House , Barack Obama is understandably focused on his legacy and reputation . 
Certainly Obama has his admirers . 
Moreover , Obama is going out with better-than-average approval ratings for a departing president . 
Most Americans long ago got over their crush on Obama , as they repeatedly demonstrated at the polls . 
In 2010 , two years after electing him president , voters trounced Obama 's party , handing Democrats the biggest midterm losses in 72 years . 
Obama was reelected in 2012 , but by nearly 4 million fewer votes than in his first election , making him the only president ever to win a second term with shrunken margins in both the popular and electoral vote . 
Two years later , with Obama imploring voters , ""-LSB- My -RSB- policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them ,"" Democrats were clobbered again . 
And in 2016 , as he campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton , Obama was increasingly adamant that his legacy was at stake . 
As a political leader , Obama has been a disaster for his party . 
After eight years under Obama , the GOP is stronger than at any time since the 1920s , and the outgoing president 's party is in tatters . 
Obama urged Americans to cast their votes as a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on his legacy . 
In almost every respect , Obama leaves behind a trail of failure and disappointment . 
Obama took office during a painful recession and -LRB- with Congress 's help -RRB- made it even worse . 
Historically , the deeper a recession , the more robust the recovery that follows , but the economy 's rebound under Obama was the worst in seven decades . 
Obama spent more public funds on ""stimulus"" than all previous stimulus programs combined , with wretched , counterproductive results . 
In 2008 , when Obama was first elected president , 63 percent of Americans considered themselves middle class . 
Obama argues energetically that his economic policies have delivered prosperity and employment . 
""Millions and millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted ,"" said Bill Clinton after Obama extolled the recovery in his last State of the Union speech , ""and they can not find themselves in it to save their lives ."" 
But Obama was certain the measure would win public support , because of three promises he made over and over : that the law would extend health insurance to the 47 million uninsured , that it would significantly reduce health insurance costs , and that Americans who had health plans or doctors they liked could keep them . 
For months , Obama and his lieutenants insisted that Syrian dictator Bashar Assad could be induced to ""reform ,"" and pointedly refused to intervene as an uprising against him metastasized into genocidal slaughter . 
At last Obama vowed to take action if Assad crossed a ""red line"" by deploying chemical weapons -- but when those weapons were used , Obama blinked . 
As a candidate for president , Obama promised to soothe America 's bitter and divisive politics , and to replace red stateblue state animosity with cooperation and bipartisanship . 
According to Gallup , Obama became the most polarizing president in modern history . 
Like all presidents , he faced partisan opposition , but Obama worsened things by regularly taking the low road and disparaging his critics ' motives . 
During his 2012 reelection campaign , Politico reported that ""Obama and his top campaign aides have engaged far more frequently in character attacks and personal insults than the Romney campaign ."" 
And when a Republican-led Congress would n't enact legislation he sought , Obama turned to his ""pen and phone"" strategy of governing by diktat that polarized politics even more . 
To his credit , Obama acknowledges that he did n't live up to his promise to reduce the angry rancor of Washington politics . 
And perhaps 60 percent of voters would not feel that their country , after two terms of Obama 's administration , is ""on the wrong track .""

It was also the high point of Obama 's presidency .","NEW YORK , NY - SEPTEMBER 23 : U.S. President Barack Obama , who is in New York City for the 69th Session of the United Nations General Assembly , speaks at the Clinton Global Initiative on September 23 , 2014 in New York City .

The Washington Post reports Russia threats went unchallenged , unnoticed under the Obama administration ; reaction and analysis Michael Caputo , former Trump campaign senior adviser , and Michael Starr Hopkins , Democratic strategist who served on President Obama and Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaigns . 
Why is it that no one in the Obama administration said , wait a second , they are trying to influence things ? 
Breaking tonight , a bombshell new report raising concerns that the Obama administration ""miscalculated the Russia threat"" , allowing Putin to launch years of attacks against the United States tampering with everything from our economy to our election . 
In the final months of the Obama administration , the final year , and yet nobody , nobody responded to these in a way that you should , if they 're trying to influence our elections . 
It describes Obama administration failing to take action until it was ""too late"" . 
CAPUTO : Well , the Obama administration had an ambassador in place in Russia named Michael McFall . 
But you know what , former President Barack Obama in his first interview since leaving the White House , very first one , tells Britain 's Prince Harry : people in power should be careful in their use of social media . 
BARACK OBAMA , 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : When you were asked what 's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America , you said Russia . 
I will say , however , the Obama administration put harsh sanctions on the Russian economy . 
OBAMA : The truth is that on the internet , everything is simplified . 
This Washington Post report is suggesting that during the administration of President Barack Obama , Russian aggression and provocations went unchecked for years . 
Who can forget early in the Obama years , new Secretary of State Hillary Clinton literally pushing the reset button , hoping for warmer relations with Russia ? 
And much later in the second term , National Security Adviser Susan Rice actually tried to justify why the Obama team was trying to walk a fine line with Vladimir Putin by not pushing back too hard . 
I would n't put it past President Obama for doing that , but it 's a curious comment coming from President Obama given the history of his divisive presidency -- the times when he went in -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- , like Ferguson , and like Baltimore , and came out against police officers in those incidents that was when they ended up being innocent . 
REGAN : I think you 're right , because I think about what treasury did under President Obama . 
But to Kayleigh 's point that President Obama was so divisive , I mean , when you look at the polling , even on this issue , President Trump , 66 percent of Americans have said that he 's done more to divide us than unite us . 
Barack Obama only ever got to 55 percent , and George Bush only got to 55 percent . 
And most notably , the White House just approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine to help them deal with Russian-backed separatist -- something the Obama administration never did despite desperate pleas from the Ukrainians . 
I just want to say President Trump 's comments about rigging the election made it really hard for President Obama and Jeh Johnson to respond to some of the hacking of Russia , because they were worried about the politicization of , you know , bringing it into the media 's network and explaining to the American people what was going on . 
REGAN : Well , let me pause you there for a second , because , you know , one of the things that the president , former President Obama is criticizing is , in fact , the use of social media and Twitter .

And somehow or another , the Obama administration took their eye off the ball . 
I think it 's quite true that Obama and his administration did n't follow through , perhaps , on a lot of this online activity , these online active measures of the Kremlin .

4747,Donald Trump ends Barack Obama 's U.N. policy . ,Barack Obama,"Republicans who criticized Mr. Obama 's approach to the United Nations , and America 's role in the world more broadly , praised Mr. Trump 's speech . 
President Obama ended his first speech to the United Nations with a call to respect universal rights and the U.N. itself , saying all nations owed an obligation to the international body . 
Democrats took the opposite view and cast Mr. Trump as reckless -- the opposite , they would argue , of the measured tone Mr. Obama consistently set . 
""Obama , at the end of the day , is a structuralist who believes that if you can get everybody into these international organizations and multilateral institutions that will promulgate norms of behavior that will condition states and prevent the need for conflict . 
He also derided the Obama administration 's nuclear deal with Iran , saying he is leaning toward pulling out of the agreement if the Islamic republic does n't cease sponsoring terrorism and fomenting discord in the Middle East . 
The United States stands ready to begin a new chapter of international cooperation , one that recognizes the rights and responsibilities of all nations ,"" Mr. Obama said in the fall of 2009 . 
""There are not two presidents who represent the two poles of that more than Obama and Trump ,"" said James Carafano , vice president of foreign policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation . 
In the place of Mr. Obama 's carefully crafted oratory were ""tweet-ready"" quotes such as the ""Rocket Man"" line , the threat to destroy North Korea and calling the Iran nuclear deal embarrassing . 
By contrast , Mr. Obama came to the United Nations in 2013 , shortly after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani rose to power , desperately seeking an agreement with the would-be nuclear power and devoting much of his address to the need for international cooperation and diplomacy . 
In addition to the president 's rhetoric , administration officials at the time were frantically trying to arrange a brief sideline meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani , attempting to secure a handshake that would signify the start of a relationship between the two decades-old foes . 
Contrasts can be drawn from Mr. Trump 's speech Tuesday and any of Mr. Obama 's addresses during his eight years in office . 
But few illustrate the difference as clearly as Mr. Obama 's first , in which he laid out a broad philosophy of breaking with the Bush administration 's interventionist foreign policy and recommitting America to the United Nations and other international groups . 
In his remarks , Mr. Obama came nowhere close to threatening Iran in the fashion Mr. Trump threatened North Korea . 
""I do believe that if we can resolve the issue of Iran 's nuclear program , that can serve as a major step down a long road toward a different relationship , one based on mutual interests and mutual respect ,"" Mr. Obama said .","Republicans who criticized Mr. Obama 's approach to the United Nations , and America 's role in the world more broadly , praised Mr. Trump 's speech .

In addition to the president 's rhetoric , administration officials at the time were frantically trying to arrange a brief sideline meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani , attempting to secure a handshake that would signify the start of a relationship between the two decades-old foes . 
Contrasts can be drawn from Mr. Trump 's speech Tuesday and any of Mr. Obama 's addresses during his eight years in office . 
But few illustrate the difference as clearly as Mr. Obama 's first , in which he laid out a broad philosophy of breaking with the Bush administration 's interventionist foreign policy and recommitting America to the United Nations and other international groups . 
In his remarks , Mr. Obama came nowhere close to threatening Iran in the fashion Mr. Trump threatened North Korea . 
""I do believe that if we can resolve the issue of Iran 's nuclear program , that can serve as a major step down a long road toward a different relationship , one based on mutual interests and mutual respect ,"" Mr. Obama said .",Neutral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Opening up science and technology is just part of the work Obama said was still to left to do . 
Barack Obama wo n't be president for much longer . 
Appearing today at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh , Obama suggested that support of science has set one candidate apart from the other in 2016 's divisive presidential election . 
As his presidency comes to an end , Obama clearly hopes that the next president will lead the way on government backing for science . 
""We do n't listen to science just when it fits our ideologies ,"" Obama said . 
Sixty years ago , when the Russians beat us to space , Obama said , the US did n't deny that Sputnik was up there . 
""I get so riled up when I hear people willfully ignore facts ,"" Obama said . 
Though he did n't mention him by name , Obama was clearly undercutting GOP candidate Donald Trump , who in this election season has so often pushed ideas that reflect the reality he wants to live in -- science be damned . 
Some of the world 's greatest innovations can also serve the cause of obfuscation , Obama said .

So , what did this unorthodox President think of what Obama had to say ? 
Shortly after his Inauguration , Trump shared with the public not only that he had received a ""beautiful"" letter from Obama but that he would ""cherish"" it . 
The tone of the inauguration day letter from outgoing President Barack Obama to President-elect Donald J. Trump , released Sunday , belongs to a different tradition , the modern presidential ritual of leaving private notes behind in the Oval Office desk as a parting gesture to its next occupant . 
And Trump 's rejection of the spirit of Obama 's letter does not seem to be just a matter of philosophy or politics , it seems personal . 
While reflective of this tradition , Obama 's ""Dear Mr. President"" letter is a departure from the billet doux of his recent predecessors -- truly unusual in the sweep of recent history . 
Less than two months later , Trump tweeted that Obama was a ""Bad -LRB- or sick -RRB- guy ."" 
While longer , and characteristic of different aspects of the man -LRB- President Obama , Professor Obama and the private Barack Obama -RRB- , the letter is also very much a product of the tumult of the 2016 election .

And yet , having seen candidate Trump 's repeated stirring of anti-constitutional passions -- his attacks on Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel , his vow to ""lock up"" his opponent , his avowed skepticism of the First Amendment -- Obama must have had one eye on history and the other on Trump when implicitly warning him of where these dark forces might lead .

4769,Justice Official Demoted as House Investigators Subpoena His Fusion GPS Meetings,Trump,A senior Justice Department official was demoted on Wednesday amid an ongoing House intelligence committee investigation into his contacts with Fusion GPS   the firm responsible for the Trump dossier   according to Fox News . Bruce G . Ohr   who was until Wednesday associate deputy attorney general   met during the 2016 campaign with the author of the dossier   Christopher Steele   according to evidence obtained by committee investigators . advertisement Ohr also met “ shortly after ” the election with Glenn Simpson   co - founder of Fusion GPS   investigators also found . Congressional sources told Fox News that Simpson and Ohr met sometime around Thanksgiving last year   when  President - elect Trump  was in the process of selecting  his  cabinet   and discussed over coffee the anti - Trump dossier   the Russia investigation and what Simpson “ considered the distressing development of Trump ’ s victory .” The meetings raise questions over the extent to which the FBI cooperated with Fusion GPS on the the Trump dossier   which was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee as opposition research . According to the Fox News report   Steele and Ohr have known each other since 2006   and Steele put Ohr in touch with Simpson . House investigators are trying to find out how the FBI used the dossier   and whether the FBI used the dossier to launch the FBI ’ s investigation into  the Trump campaign    or to obtain a surveillance warrant against members of  the Trump campaign    and whether it ever paid for the dossier   as some reports have said . House investigators are now seeking more information from the FBI on the contacts between Ohr and Steele   and between Ohr and Simpson . Committee Chairman Devin Nunes ( R - CA ) issued a new subpoena Thursday regarding Ohr and his files   according to Fox News . While Ohr is no longer associate deputy attorney general — a position that put him four doors down from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   he will remain director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces ( OCDETF )  a program overseeing the attorney general ’ s drug strategy . The Justice Department official characterized the demotion as normal : “ It is unusual for anyone to wear two hats as he has done recently . This person is going to go back to a single focus — director of our organized crime and drug enforcement unit . As you know   combating transnational criminal organizations and drug trafficking is a top priority for the attorney general .” But Ohr ’ s demotion marks the second time within months that the Justice Department and the FBI have disciplined a senior official “ for misconduct ” connected to the Russia probe   according to Fox News . Peter Strzok   a high - ranking FBI official   was dismissed from Special Counsel Robert Mueller ’ s team in July for sending anti - Trump text messages to another colleague on the team with whom he was having an extramarital affair . Disclosure of the texts came only this week   to the New York Times and the Washington Post   as the Justice Department agreed to make Strzok available to the committee for testimony . The leaks were reminiscent of leaks revealing that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had funded the dossier — just before the committee forced Fusion GPS to hand over financial records by subpoena .

4770,Democrats are now firmly behind single,Trump,payer health plan ( or thereabouts )  planting a significant marker in the evolution of the Democratic Party   and eventually perhaps the American health - care system . And we have President Trump and the Republicans to thank for it . CAP calls its plan “ Medicare Extra For All .” That ’ s a little unwieldy but seems meant to distinguish it from “ Medicare For All  ” which is what Bernie Sanders called the plan he proposed in 2016 and what others have called for . It isn ’ t a true single - payer plan because it envisions a continued role for private insurance . But it greatly expands government coverage   both for anyone who doesn ’ t have insurance and   critically   anyone who simply would prefer the government ’ s plan . It ’ s significant that this plan is coming from the heart of the Democratic establishment   a think tank that is the closest thing to a Democratic government - in - exile . When it has officially put its imprimatur on a sort - of single - payer health plan   that means the general principle is now all but consensus among Democrats   something that wasn ’ t true even a year ago . While this evolution has been in - process for a while   the fact is that as of now   the Democratic Party is converging on consensus around the goal of universal coverage with a much stronger role for government . You may recall that in the last presidential election   the party ’ s candidate wasn ’ t willing to go that far . Today   nearly every Democrat considering a run for the White House in 2020 has endorsed the idea of universal coverage .  President Trump  repeatedly promised to preserve Medicare   Medicaid and Social Security benefits in campaign speeches and debates . Will  he  stick to  his  campaign promises ? ( Peter Stevenson / The Washington Post ) It ’ s possible that this movement would have happened no matter what Republicans had done in the past year . But it ’ s hard to argue that the GOP hasn ’ t helped push the Democrats in this direction   and thereby helped accelerate the arrival of a universal health - care system . First   Republicans attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act   which had the effect of reminding everyone how many people have benefited from it . In particular   the prospect of tossing millions of people off Medicaid revealed that government insurance is actually quite popular with the public   encouraging Democrats to go ahead and advocate a further expansion of the government ’ s role . The dynamics of opposition have also played a part . When you ’ re out of power   not only do you have to draw a stark contrast with the party in power   but also your frustrated and angry base encourages you to eschew half - measures . “ Like the ACA   but a little better ” is no longer a tenable position to take to Democratic voters . That ’ s particularly true given what the administration and Republican states have been doing on health care . To sum it up   they ’ ve engaged in a concerted effort to make sure that fewer people have health coverage and that the coverage that exists is worse . The administration has encouraged states to force Medicaid patients to navigate cumbersome bureaucratic requirements   including logging their work hours and paying small premiums   with the plain goal of kicking as many people off the program as possible . They ’ ve promoted junk insurance that doesn ’ t cover essential health benefits . They ’ ve moved toward abandoning the payment reforms in the ACA   which attempted to transition from the fee - for - service model that has helped drive spending so high and toward a system that encourages keeping patients healthier . That ’ s all in line with their philosophical perspective   which is that government should cover as few people as possible and if the market doesn ’ t provide you with affordable coverage that actually covers you   then it ’ s just too bad . But is there a single person willing to predict that by 2020 — when we have more uninsured   costs are higher   and coverage is less secure — the American public is going to say   “ Gee   the Republicans have done a terrific job on health care ”? Even if Republicans in Congress have largely shelved their attempts to destroy the ACA   their party is still working to fulfill its extremely conservative health - care vision . Meanwhile   the Democratic Party has decided that it ’ s both morally right and politically advantageous to move to the left . The CAP plan   like what most Democrats are now advocating   is not a strict single - payer plan . But it would achieve universal coverage   which is the core goal of single - payer . And as we ’ ve seen before   it ’ s the role of groups like CAP to do the work of policy development on behalf of their party ’ s politicians so they have a starting point for change when they retake power . Don ’ t be surprised if some of the 2020 candidates essentially adopt this   or something very much like it   as their own . So here are some key features of the CAP plan : Everyone would be eligible for Medicare Extra . If you have employer coverage   existing Medicare   VA coverage or anything else   you ’ d have the option to stay with what you ’ ve got or enroll in the new plan . Anyone without insurance would be automatically enrolled as soon as they show up at the doctor or a hospital ; children would also be automatically enrolled at birth . A wide range of benefits would be covered   including preventive care   hospitalization   dental and vision   and mental health treatment . Those with incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level would pay no premiums ; above that premiums would rise on a sliding scale capped at 10 percent of income . Deductibles   co - payments and out - of - pocket costs would also vary by income . Employer - provided coverage would remain   but employers could choose to enroll their employees in Medicare Extra instead . Individuals could also choose to leave their employer plan and enroll in Medicare Extra . Medicaid and CHIP would be integrated into the new plan . Costs would be brought down by paying something similar to current Medicare rates to providers   negotiating lower drug prices   implementing payment reforms and streamlining the health - care bureaucracy . Premiums would be collected through the tax system   and new excise taxes and taxes on high earners would pay for the costs that remain . It ’ s an ambitious plan   but it ’ s also politically savvy . First   unlike the ACA   it ’ s easy to explain . You can say   “ Anyone who wants Medicare can get it  ” which may not be 100 percent accurate ( it would be similar to existing Medicare but not identical )  but it basically describes the idea . Second   the only easily identifiable losers are the rich   who ’ d see some tax increases — and that ’ s something most Americans were in favor of even before the GOP passed a ginormous tax cut for corporations and the wealthy . And it incorporates plenty of free choice for both individuals and employers . That doesn ’ t mean Republicans won ’ t hate it ( Big government ! Washington getting between you and your doctor ! )  but they ’ ve got no one to blame but themselves . If they had left the ACA alone and not been working so hard to make American health care worse and less secure   the Democrats might not have been pushed this far this fast . But that ’ s where the Democratic Party is now   and it ’ s not going back . More from Opinions : Our health - care system is still a mess .  Trump  isn ’ t doing anything serious about  it  .

But it ’ s hard to argue that the GOP hasn ’ t helped push the Democrats in this direction   and thereby helped accelerate the arrival of a universal health - care system . First   Republicans attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act   which had the effect of reminding everyone how many people have benefited from it . In particular   the prospect of tossing millions of people off Medicaid revealed that government insurance is actually quite popular with the public   encouraging Democrats to go ahead and advocate a further expansion of the government ’ s role . The dynamics of opposition have also played a part . When you ’ re out of power   not only do you have to draw a stark contrast with the party in power   but also your frustrated and angry base encourages you to eschew half - measures . “ Like the ACA   but a little better ” is no longer a tenable position to take to Democratic voters . That ’ s particularly true given what the administration and Republican states have been doing on health care . To sum it up   they ’ ve engaged in a concerted effort to make sure that fewer people have health coverage and that the coverage that exists is worse . The administration has encouraged states to force Medicaid patients to navigate cumbersome bureaucratic requirements   including logging their work hours and paying small premiums   with the plain goal of kicking as many people off the program as possible . They ’ ve promoted junk insurance that doesn ’ t cover essential health benefits . They ’ ve moved toward abandoning the payment reforms in the ACA   which attempted to transition from the fee - for - service model that has helped drive spending so high and toward a system that encourages keeping patients healthier . That ’ s all in line with their philosophical perspective   which is that government should cover as few people as possible and if the market doesn ’ t provide you with affordable coverage that actually covers you   then it ’ s just too bad . But is there a single person willing to predict that by 2020 — when we have more uninsured   costs are higher   and coverage is less secure — the American public is going to say   “ Gee   the Republicans have done a terrific job on health care ”? Even if Republicans in Congress have largely shelved their attempts to destroy the ACA   their party is still working to fulfill its extremely conservative health - care vision . Meanwhile   the Democratic Party has decided that it ’ s both morally right and politically advantageous to move to the left . The CAP plan   like what most Democrats are now advocating   is not a strict single - payer plan . But it would achieve universal coverage   which is the core goal of single - payer . And as we ’ ve seen before   it ’ s the role of groups like CAP to do the work of policy development on behalf of their party ’ s politicians so they have a starting point for change when they retake power . Don ’ t be surprised if some of the 2020 candidates essentially adopt this   or something very much like it   as their own . So here are some key features of the CAP plan : Everyone would be eligible for Medicare Extra . If you have employer coverage   existing Medicare   VA coverage or anything else   you ’ d have the option to stay with what you ’ ve got or enroll in the new plan . Anyone without insurance would be automatically enrolled as soon as they show up at the doctor or a hospital ; children would also be automatically enrolled at birth . A wide range of benefits would be covered   including preventive care   hospitalization   dental and vision   and mental health treatment . Those with incomes below 150 percent of the poverty level would pay no premiums ; above that premiums would rise on a sliding scale capped at 10 percent of income . Deductibles   co - payments and out - of - pocket costs would also vary by income . Employer - provided coverage would remain   but employers could choose to enroll their employees in Medicare Extra instead . Individuals could also choose to leave their employer plan and enroll in Medicare Extra . Medicaid and CHIP would be integrated into the new plan . Costs would be brought down by paying something similar to current Medicare rates to providers   negotiating lower drug prices   implementing payment reforms and streamlining the health - care bureaucracy . Premiums would be collected through the tax system   and new excise taxes and taxes on high earners would pay for the costs that remain . It ’ s an ambitious plan   but it ’ s also politically savvy . First   unlike the ACA   it ’ s easy to explain . You can say   “ Anyone who wants Medicare can get it  ” which may not be 100 percent accurate ( it would be similar to existing Medicare but not identical )  but it basically describes the idea . Second   the only easily identifiable losers are the rich   who ’ d see some tax increases — and that ’ s something most Americans were in favor of even before the GOP passed a ginormous tax cut for corporations and the wealthy . And it incorporates plenty of free choice for both individuals and employers . That doesn ’ t mean Republicans won ’ t hate it ( Big government ! Washington getting between you and your doctor ! )  but they ’ ve got no one to blame but themselves . If they had left the ACA alone and not been working so hard to make American health care worse and less secure   the Democrats might not have been pushed this far this fast . But that ’ s where the Democratic Party is now   and it ’ s not going back . More from Opinions : Our health - care system is still a mess .  Trump  isn ’ t doing anything serious about  it  . If the poor must work to earn every dollar   shouldn ’ t the rich ?

4772,How Trump's Corporate Tax Cut Is Playing Out For Wal,Trump,"Mart Companies like Wal - Mart say tax cuts are making it possible for them to boost wages . But other economic factors could also be contributing to pay increases . MICHEL MARTIN   HOST : This week   Walmart joined a chorus of companies who say the big corporate tax cut is motivating them to raise wages   pay bonuses and make more investments . But that good news story was undercut later in the same day when word trickled out that Walmart is closing 63 of its Sam ' s Club warehouse stores and laying off thousands of workers . We ' ve asked NPR economics correspondent John Ydstie to join us to sort this out . So   John   thanks for joining us   first of all . JOHN YDSTIE   BYLINE : Happy to be here   Michel . MARTIN : Well   Walmart seems to be feeling generous with some of its employees and laying off others . And what role is the tax cut playing in this   if any ? YDSTIE : Well   there ' s no doubt that Walmart and many other companies are very happy that the top corporate tax rate was slashed from 35 to 21 percent . It ' ll save Walmart billions of dollars a year . And it certainly makes it easier for the company to raise its minimum wage to 11 bucks an hour . But there are other forces at work here that have little to do with the tax cut . MARTIN : Well   what are those forces ? YDSTIE : Well   the U . S . unemployment rate is down to just over 4 percent   very close to full employment . So Walmart needs to raise wages just to attract and hang onto employees . And there ' s evidence that that helps . Walmart boosted wages and training back in 2015 . And according to the analysts   that helped them increase same - store sales continuously since then . MARTIN : Well   that invites the question of why Walmart is closing 10 percent of its Sam ' s Clubs   and as we understand it   that that means laying off some 11   000 workers . Well   even though the overall economy is strong   for traditional retailers   there are challenges like online shopping . Walmart says those Sam ' s Club stores were underperforming . The company does say it is going to convert about a dozen of them to e - commerce fulfillment centers   so some of those workers may be rehired . MARTIN : But as we said earlier   it ' s not just Walmart saying the tax cut is motivating them to boost wages and investment . AT & T and Wells Fargo   just to name a couple of companies that people may have heard in the news   are saying the same things or similar things . How should we assess what they ' re saying ? YDSTIE : Well   I think in the case of both of them   there are additional factors at play . For one thing   both have a reason to try to curry favor in Washington . MARTIN : Because Wells Fargo is being penalized by the government for deceiving customers . And  President Trump  has threatened even more punishments . So Wells Fargo has an interest in saying the tax cut is the reason it ' s boosting wages for its employees   precisely what  the president  predicted would happen   in order to gain favor with  Trump  and avoid more penalties . That said   Wells Fargo is also competing for workers in a strong economy   so they might have boosted wages whether there was a tax cut or not . MARTIN : But what about AT & T ? YDSTIE : We don '  t  know for sure . But remember   AT &  T  wants to buy Time Warner   but  the Trump administration  is blocking that deal in court . So AT &  T  could be thinking that saying the tax cut motivated the company to pay big bonuses to workers might just get  the Trump administration  to ease its opposition to the deal . MARTIN : So the economy is pretty strong right now . Is that the result of these tax cuts ? YDSTIE : Well   business confidence in the U . S . has risen in the past year   partly anticipating the tax cut and also in response to regulatory restraint by  the Trump administration  . So that may have boosted the U . S . economy a bit   but the economy was already on a solid foundation . And a good deal of the recent pickup is due to the very positive global economic picture   which has little   if anything   to do with U . S . taxes .

4775,They Don't Call It 'The Great Tweet of China',Trump,"- he ' d be the greatest jobs president God ever created   he ' d cut taxes   he ' d balance the budget   he ' d give all Americans fantastic health care   he ' d renegotiate NAFTA   he ' d scotch the Iran deal and so on . But there was one central promise without which he wouldn ' t have been elected : He said he ' d build a wall . Either  Trump  understood the urgency of our border crisis   as  his  every campaign speech suggested   or it was just meaningless boilerplate to get  himself  elected . If it was the latter   then our search continues for one politician who won ' t lie to us . It was precisely the Nietzschean Eternal Recurrence of politicians promising to get tough on immigration   but never   ever doing it   that caused voters to cling to  Trump  like a life vest in a tidal wave . If  Trump  actually believed what  he  claimed to believe    he  would treat the building of a wall as a far more urgent priority than sending FEMA after a hurricane . Taking nothing away from the fine people who lost their lives in the recent hurricanes   since the 2005 hurricane season   about 200 Americans have died in hurricanes   plus 82 in Hurricane Harvey and 50 in Hurricane Irma . That ' s 332 deaths from hurricanes in the past 12 years . Even a federal government determined not to tell Americans how many illegal immigrants are committing crimes admits that -- at a minimum -- there are 350   000 illegal immigrants incarcerated in state prisons and jails   and 3   500 are in for murder . Considering that the average time served for murder in America is six years   that means that   in the last 12 years   hurricanes have killed 332 Americans   and illegal immigrants have killed 7   000 Americans . Throw in the more than 30   000 Americans who die every year from heroin and fentanyl brought in by Mexicans   and illegal immigration is a problem at least 100 times more urgent than Hurricanes Harvey   Irma and every other hurricane since 2005   combined . ( If we ' re including U . S . territories and Hurricane Maria ends up killing another 100 people -- current estimates are zero dead -- illegal immigration is still 80 times worse than the last 12 years of deadly hurricanes .

We thought  Trump  understood this . We were counting on  him  to fight for us on the border -- not with rallies   not with hats   not with tweets   but by building a wall . And yet   as of Wednesday this week   Trump will have been in office 243 days without having begun the wall . Imagine if Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had hit 243 days ago and all we ' d gotten from the president were assurances that FEMA would be coming any day now -- just as soon as he got the go - ahead from Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan ! ( Or worse   from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer .) The more accurate analogy would be if  Trump  responded to the recent hurricanes not only by sending zero federal aid   but also by demanding that we dismantle FEMA and the National Hurricane Center . That ' s exactly what  he  ' s doing by proposing we respond to the crisis of 40 million illegal aliens in our country with an amnesty that will lure another 40 million across the border . We hoped we wouldn ' t have to spell it out . We thought  Trump  understood that this was an emergency . We believed  he  was capable of getting the job done . If  he  did understand   then 243 days ago    he  would have sent the Navy Seabees and Army Corps of Engineers to start building the wall . For most of the nation ' s history   the primary job of the military -- of which President Trump is the commander in chief -- was building walls and fortresses on our borders . That ' s why we have an Army Corps of Engineers . It may not seem like it from recent history   but the job of our military is to protect America ' s borders -- not Ukraine ' s borders   not Jordan ' s borders . This is our one and only chance to get this done   and we ' re losing the fight . While Trump dallies   last week California became a sanctuary state .

If Trump doesn ' t get that wall built   and fast   his base will be done with him and feed him to Robert Mueller .","- he ' d be the greatest jobs president God ever created   he ' d cut taxes   he ' d balance the budget   he ' d give all Americans fantastic health care   he ' d renegotiate NAFTA   he ' d scotch the Iran deal and so on . But there was one central promise without which he wouldn ' t have been elected : He said he ' d build a wall . Either  [TGT]understood the urgency of our border crisis   as  [TGT]  every campaign speech suggested   or it was just meaningless boilerplate to get  [TGT]  elected . If it was the latter   then our search continues for one politician who won ' t lie to us . It was precisely the Nietzschean Eternal Recurrence of politicians promising to get tough on immigration   but never   ever doing it   that caused voters to cling to  Trump  like a life vest in a tidal wave . If  [TGT]actually believed what  he  claimed to believe    [TGT]  would treat the building of a wall as a far more urgent priority than sending FEMA after a hurricane . Taking nothing away from the fine people who lost their lives in the recent hurricanes   since the 2005 hurricane season   about 200 Americans have died in hurricanes   plus 82 in Hurricane Harvey and 50 in Hurricane Irma . That ' s 332 deaths from hurricanes in the past 12 years . Even a federal government determined not to tell Americans how many illegal immigrants are committing crimes admits that -- at a minimum -- there are 350   000 illegal immigrants incarcerated in state prisons and jails   and 3   500 are in for murder . Considering that the average time served for murder in America is six years   that means that   in the last 12 years   hurricanes have killed 332 Americans   and illegal immigrants have killed 7   000 Americans . Throw in the more than 30   000 Americans who die every year from heroin and fentanyl brought in by Mexicans   and illegal immigration is a problem at least 100 times more urgent than Hurricanes Harvey   Irma and every other hurricane since 2005   combined . ( If we ' re including U . S . territories and Hurricane Maria ends up killing another 100 people -- current estimates are zero dead -- illegal immigration is still 80 times worse than the last 12 years of deadly hurricanes . Of course   if we ' re including territories   then we also must note that illegal immigration is especially disastrous for Puerto Ricans living in the U . S .  in terms of crime and diminishing job prospects .)

Labor statistics show that foreign companies have been the source of the majority of new manufacturing jobs since the 2009 recession.

4779,Report: Trump Was 'Riled Up' by Gen. Kelly's Claim President 'Evolved' on Border Wall,Trump,"President Trump  was “riled up” by comments made by White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly  who claimed that the president had “evolved” on his demand for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
According to the New York Times   Trump  had become angry that Kelly said in an interview this week that the president’s views on immigration and border security had somehow softened.
Kelly said of  Trump ’s supposed “evolutionary process:”
“There’s been an evolutionary process that this president has gone through ” Kelly said in an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier  pointing out that  Trump  had “very definitely changed  his  attitude” towards DACA recipients and the wall. “ He  has evolved in the way  he ’s looked at things ” Kelly said. “Campaign to governing are two different things and this president has been very  very flexible in terms of what is within the realm of the possible.”
After hearing the comments  the New York Times says  Trump  was “initially calm ” but that after speaking with colleagues and friends   he  became “riled up” that Kelly had undermined him publicly on his staunch pro-American immigration reform agenda.
Yet early Wednesday evening  after learning from a White House aide that his chief of staff  John F. Kelly  had described his views about his signature campaign pledge to build a wall on the Mexico border as “not informed ” and his thinking as “evolving ” the president was initially calm. It did not last. By Wednesday night   Mr. Trump  had become convinced by a string of allies and friends  he  had talked to on the phone that Mr. Kelly had undermined  him   according to people familiar with the conversations. And by Thursday morning  after digesting accounts of Mr. Kelly’s comments on cable news  the president was riled up. As the television blared  he typed out a series of tweets that rebutted Mr. Kelly without actually naming him. “The Wall is the Wall  it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it ”  Mr. Trump  wrote at 6:15 a.m. Later in the morning   the president  spoke to  his  chief of staff  and made  his  displeasure clear  according to two people familiar with the conversation.
As mentioned by the New York Times report   Trump  refuted Kelly’s statements online  without mentioning  his  Chief of Staff.

4780,Trump Defends Alleged Wife,Trump,"On Friday   President Trump  spoke to the press about ousted aide Rob Porter  who left the White House after two ex-wives accused him of spousal abuse and one provided a photo of herself with a black eye.  Trump  defended Porter  stating  “it was very sad when we heard about it  and certainly   he ’s very sad now. As you probably know   he  says  he ’s innocent. And I think you have to remember that.  He  said very strongly yesterday that  he ’s innocent  so you’ll have to talk to  him  about that. But we absolutely wish  him  well. Did a very good job while  he  was at the White House.”

For  Trump   Porter’s denial is enough to allow him to wish Porter well. The same does not hold true for Omarosa  who isn’t accused of punching a woman in the eye  but who did say she wouldn’t vote for  Trump  in 2020. She got shellacked from the White House podium yesterday.
So  it seems that  Trump ’s standard of belief relies on the denial of the accused. But not always  obviously.  Trump  spent most of the 2016 election cycle chanting “Lock her up!” regarding Hillary Clinton  who was never charged with or convicted of a crime.  He  wasn’t wrong to believe that Hillary had committed criminal acts. But her denial wasn’t enough for  him .
And  of course   Trump  was in fine fettle with regard to the Central Park Five:

Denials are only enough in the realm of sexual abuse and assault  apparently. Back in 1992   Trump  defended convicted rapist Mike Tyson  stating  “You have a young woman that was in  his  room   his  hotel room late in the evening at  her  own will. You have a young woman who was seen dancing for the beauty contest  dancing with a big smile on her face  looked happy as could be.” He proposed no jail time for Tyson.
 Trump  used the Rob Porter excuse with Roy Moore as well  stating  “You have to listen to him also…He totally denies it.” And way back when   Trump  even defended Bill Clinton  calling his accusers “terrible” and “unattractive.”
But  Trump ’s rule regarding denials regarding sexual abuse cease to apply if  he  can attack  his  political opponents. So during the campaign   Trump  held a campaign press conference with four accusers against Clinton; in open debate   he  stated  “There’s never been anybody in the history of politics that has been so abusive to women.” Clinton  of course  denied such abuse.
 Trump ’s rule makes a good deal of practical sense:  he ’s been accused by a bevy of women of both sexual harassment and assault.  He  denies it. Therefore   he  has to take everyone else’s denials at face value.
But suffice it to say that  Trump ’s standard puts decent conservatives at severe moral risk. The question here isn’t whether  Trump  stands for “innocent until proven guilty.”  He  doesn’t. The question is whether Republicans are willing to stand by while other Republicans are credibly accused of awful offenses  tut-tutting about “denials ” all in order to mirror  Trump ’s self-serving standard.","On Friday   [TGT]spoke to the press about ousted aide Rob Porter  who left the White House after two ex-wives accused him of spousal abuse and one provided a photo of herself with a black eye.

4782,Trump says senator 'would do anything' for cash,Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Pushing into the sexual harassment debate   President Donald Trump  laced into Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday  tweeting that the New York Democrat had begged him for campaign contributions in the past and “would do anything” to get them. Democrats accused the president of comments that were crude and worse.
Gillibrand  D-N.Y.  who had called for  Trump ’s resignation a day earlier while citing allegations of sexual misconduct  called  Trump ’s attack a “sexist smear attempting to silence my voice.”
The Democrats were badly misreading the president’s comments  said  Trump  spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “There’s no way”  his  tweet was sexist  she said  and only people with their minds in the gutter would read anything sexual into it.
Standing up for Gillibrand  Sen. Elizabeth Warren  D-Mass.  tweeted to the president: “Are you really trying to bully  intimidate and slut-shame @SenGillibrand? Do you know who you’re picking a fight with? Good luck with that  @realDonaldTrump. Nevertheless  #shepersisted.”
 Trump ’s tweet Tuesday did not directly address sexual harassment  but said of Gillibrand: “Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand  a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them)  is now in the ring fighting against  Trump . Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!”
A day earlier  Gillibrand said  Trump  should resign because there were credible accusations against  him . And barring that  she said  “Congress should investigate the multiple sexual harassment and assault allegations against  him .”
Trump’s tweet Tuesday morning inflamed Democrats who said  the president  was again debasing a woman.  Trump  had not responded to earlier resignation calls from three male senators  Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.
Hours later  Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono also called for  the president  to step down  declaring that  Trump ’s “tweet against Kirsten was just another example of his misogyny.”
The criticism of  Trump  largely came from one side of the aisle. Republicans largely remained silent about the tweet  with  Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake  a frequent Trump critic  being an exception   saying  he  “didn’t think it was appropriate at all.”
More than a dozen women came forward during last year’s campaign  many in the wake of the “Access Hollywood” tape in which  Trump  is heard bragging about committing sexual assault  to say that the celebrity businessman had harassed them.
With each day seeming to bring new headlines that force men from positions of power  four of  Trump ’s accusers re-upped their claims Monday  believing the national movement on sexual harassment should force change at the White House too.
 Trump  has denied the claims. In a heated exchange with reporters in the White House briefing room on Monday  press secretary Sanders steadfastly dismissed accusations against the Republican president and suggested the issue had been decided in  Trump ’s favor on Election Day.
Sanders also promised that the White House would provide a list of eyewitnesses and corroborating evidence to exonerate  Trump . Nearly 24 hours later  the White House sent along an email that  citing news reports that quote witnesses  offered rebuttals to two of the accusations.

4785,Trump Will Not Immediately Release Democratic Memo Suggests Revisions,Trump,"Updated at 9:53 p.m.  ET
President Trump  will not immediately release a memo drafted by Democrats on the House intelligence committee intended to respond to a memo by that committee's Republican chairman released last week  with the White House instead suggesting revisions of sensitive sections before it is made available to the public.
The Democratic countermemo  authored by the committee's ranking member Adam Schiff  D-Calif.  was drafted in response to the Nunes memo which contends that officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI abused their authority in authorizing surveillance on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page.
The House intelligence committee voted Monday to release the Democratic memo  but it was up to  President Trump  whether or not to declassify the information contained it and give  his  approval for its release as  he  did last week with the Nunes memo. Democrats urged  him  to make the memo public  and even top Republican leaders such as House Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  agreed it should be released just as the Nunes memo had been.
Schiff said in a statement that Trump had released Nunes' ""deeply flawed and inaccurate memo"" without any redactions and despite concerns voiced by the Justice Department and the FBI  which ""was described by the agencies as extraordinarily reckless and omitting material facts.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D-N.Y.  blasted Trump's decision  saying the president's ""double standard when it comes to transparency is appalling.""
After the Nunes memo was released   Trump  saw the document as evidence that the investigation by DOJ special counsel Robert Mueller was politically motivated.
""This memo totally vindicates ' Trump ' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their [sic] was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because  after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING  collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!"" the president tweeted last Saturday  one day after the Nunes memo was released.
However  the Nunes memo also shows that the Justice Department and the FBI did not launch their probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election because of  an unverified dossier about Trump and Russia compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele . Republicans have seized on  the Steele dossier  because he was commissioned by the political research firm Fusion GPS  which was hired by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign.
Instead  it was  Trump  campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and meetings he had with agents of the Kremlin where he was offered dirt on Hillary Clinton that triggered the investigation  the Nunes memo says. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and Russian agents.
Trump also seized on revelations in the Nunes memo that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved a warrant application for surveillance on Page  raising the specter that the president could fire him which would trigger a potential crisis in who would oversee Mueller's investigation  since Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from the probe.

We’re not much further along than we were Monday in piecing together the explanation for former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe’s abrupt departure. Reports are disturbing insofar as they paint a picture of a vengeful president who is out of control and of a chief of staff  John F. Kelly  helping  President Trump  to muscle McCabe out of his post. Bloomberg reports: 
Trump  erupted in anger while traveling to Davos after learning that Associate Attorney General Stephen Boyd warned that it would be “extraordinarily reckless” to release a classified memo written by House Republican staffers. The memo outlines alleged misdeeds at the FBI and Justice Department related to the Russia investigation. For  Trump   the letter was yet another example of the Justice Department undermining  him  and stymieing Republican efforts to expose what the president sees as the politically motivated agenda behind Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.  Trump ’s outburst capped a week where  Trump  and senior White House officials personally reproached Attorney General Jeff Sessions and asked White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to speak to others — episodes that illustrate  Trump ’s preoccupation with the Justice Department  according to two of the people.
Once again  we see evidence that  Trump  believes the Justice Department should be working for  him  and allowing House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes’s spurious memo to be released (because  Trump  thinks it helps  him ).  Trump  sees nothing wrong with strong-arming those involved in an investigation of  him  out the door.  He  blows up when the DOJ acts on national security grounds and when it complicates a campaign to smear the FBI.
Opinion   If  President Trump  were to fire the bane of  his  legal troubles   he  could spark a legal and constitutional crisis. Post Opinion writer Quinta Jurecic lays out how  Trump  could get rid of special counsel Robert Mueller  and what would happen as a result. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)
Former Justice spokesman Matt Miller observes that “even beyond the criminal question  which we spend a lot of time on for good reason. . . .the idea of the White House trying to intervene in matters involving an investigation into the president is beyond unacceptable.” The White House spokeswoman’s denial that  Trump  had any role to play in McCabe’s departure is laughable  and once again raises the question as to why the White House continues to mislead and coverup its actions if it believes the president is behaving properly.
What is also apparent is that far from a moderating influence  Kelly is a foot soldier in  Trump’s  effort to intimidate the FBI. “After  Trump ’s strong reaction on Air Force One over the Boyd letter  White House officials  including Kelly  sprang into action again  lashing Justice Department officials Thursday over the decision to send the letter ” Bloomberg reports.
There are vivid  telling details providing insight into  Trump ’s small-minded  vindictive approach to “governing” — if you can call it that. NBC News reports  Trump  called McCabe the day after the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey to grouse that Comey was allowed to take a government plane home from Los Angeles:
McCabe told the president he hadn’t been asked to authorize Comey’s flight  but if anyone had asked  he would have approved it  three people familiar with the call recounted to NBC News. The president was silent for a moment and then turned on McCabe  suggesting he ask his wife how it feels to be a loser — an apparent reference to a failed campaign for state office in Virginia that McCabe’s wife made in 2015. McCabe replied  “OK  sir.”  Trump  then hung up the phone.
The White House denies the report  evidencing some awareness that it portrays  Trump  as a raving lunatic and petty tyrant. But why after all the lies (Never considered firing Robert S. Mueller? No contacts with Russians by the campaign?) would we believe anything the White House has to say at this point?
However  if this was all part of an attempt by  Trump  to intimidate witnesses  discredit  his  own Justice Department and bring the FBI to heel  then it most certainly is another piece of the obstruction puzzle.
Before the latest news  one legal analyst pointed out that if it is true  as a Foreign Policy report alleged  that  Trump  launched an organized smear campaign against McCabe; chief of staff and senior counselor to the director of the FBI Jim Rybicki; and former FBI general counsel James A. Baker  then the federal witness tampering statute (18 USC Section 1512) might come into play. That statute makes it illegal to use intimidation  threaten  or corruptly persuade another person  or attempts to do so with intent  among other things  to induce someone to change or withhold testimony or to “hinder  delay  or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer or judge of the United States of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a Federal offense.”
It will be tough to prove the character assassination plan “rose to the level of a knowing attempt to intimidate  threaten or corruptly persuade the men not to testify in front of Mueller or whether the campaign against them was intended to somehow delay or alter their testimony in a way that would not have occurred but for the campaign itself.” Nevertheless  Section 1512 (c) separately gives Mueller some more running room. That subsection makes it illegal to “corruptly” take action that “otherwise obstructs  influences  or impedes any official proceeding  or attempts to do so.” That generic catch-all could well  if the press accounts prove true  pose one more legal problem for  Trump .
In any event  one does get the sense the wheels are coming off the bus at the White House.  Trump ’s level of panic is rising and  his  subordinates’ ability to contain  him  and prevent  him  from acting on  his  impulses seems to be diminishing. If not committing new crimes  he’s giving  Mueller  plenty of evidence of his “corrupt” intent.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court will wade into a political battle between President Trump and the nation's most liberal appeals court this fall by hearing four cases at the start of its upcoming term that the administration wants overturned.
Tops on the list is Trump's temporary travel ban aimed at immigrants from six majority-Muslim nations and refugees. It was struck down by the 9th Circuit appeals court based in San Francisco  as well as the 4th Circuit appeals court in Richmond. The justices partially reinstated the ban in June and will hear oral arguments Oct. 10.
The last case pits decisions made by the 9th and 7th Circuit appeals courts against the 5th Circuit's ruling that forced arbitration clauses in employee contracts do not violate federal law. The 9th Circuit ruled in favor of the workers. In an unusual move  the Justice Department under  Trump  has switched sides and now favors employers.
 Trump  has derided the California-based court ever since  its  judges ruled against an earlier version of  his  travel ban in February.  He  stepped up  his  criticism by calling for the circuit to be broken up after a federal district judge in California — who does not sit on the appeals court — temporarily blocked the president's order cutting funds to sanctuary cities in April.
“First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities — both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” Trump tweeted in April.
Arizona Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain have proposed splitting it into two circuits  something Trump has endorsed but Democrats and liberal interest groups oppose.
""The simple fact is that  calls by President Trump and Senate Republicans to split the Ninth Circuit  are simply a political response to decisions  they  don’t like ” Sen. Dianne Feinstein  D-Calif.  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee  said.
• A three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld a federal district court judge's ruling in Hawaii that the travel ban was unconstitutional. The panel did not rule on religious grounds  as other courts had done. Instead  it said  Trump  exceeded  his  power to regulate immigration.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court will wade into a political battle between President Trump and the nation's most liberal appeals court this fall by hearing four cases at the start of its upcoming term that the administration wants overturned.
Tops on the list is [TGT]'s temporary travel ban aimed at immigrants from six majority-Muslim nations and refugees. It was struck down by the 9th Circuit appeals court based in San Francisco  as well as the 4th Circuit appeals court in Richmond. The justices partially reinstated [TGT] in June and will hear oral arguments Oct. 10.
The last case pits decisions made by the 9th and 7th Circuit appeals courts against the 5th Circuit's ruling that forced arbitration clauses in employee contracts do not violate federal law. The 9th Circuit ruled in favor of the workers. In an unusual move  the Justice Department under  [TGT]has switched sides and now favors employers.
 [TGT]has derided the California-based court ever since  [TGT]  judges ruled against an earlier version of  [TGT]  travel ban in February.  [TGT]  stepped up  [TGT]  criticism by calling for the circuit to be broken up after a federal district judge in California — who does not sit on the appeals court — temporarily blocked the president's order cutting funds to sanctuary cities in April.
“First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities — both ridiculous rulings. See you in the Supreme Court!” [TGT] tweeted in April.
Arizona Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain have proposed splitting it into two circuits  something [TGT] has endorsed but Democrats and liberal interest groups oppose.
""The simple fact is that  calls by President Trump and Senate Republicans to split the Ninth Circuit  are simply a political response to decisions  they  don’t like ” Sen. Dianne Feinstein  D-Calif.  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee  said.
• A three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld a federal district court judge's ruling in Hawaii that the travel ban was unconstitutional. The panel did not rule on religious grounds  as other courts had done. Instead  it said  [TGT]  exceeded  his  power to regulate immigration.
• In Jennings v. Rodriguez  the appeals court ruled that immigrants facing deportation are entitled to bond hearings at least every six months. In January  however   [TGT]ended the ""catch and release"" policy that required such hearings. The justices likely were tied 4-4 on the case and rescheduled it for the second day of the new term.

4788,Trump judge nominee 36 who has never tried a case wins approval of Senate panel,Trump,"Brett J. Talley  President  Trump ’s nominee to be a federal judge in Alabama  has never tried a case  was unanimously rated “not qualified” by the American Bar Assn.’s judicial rating committee  has practiced law for only three years and  as a blogger last year  displayed a degree of partisanship unusual for a judicial nominee  denouncing “Hillary Rotten Clinton” and pledging support for the National Rifle Assn.
Talley  36  is part of what  Trump  has called the “untold story” of his success in filling the courts with young conservatives.
“The judge story is an untold story. Nobody wants to talk about it ”  Trump  said last month  standing alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in the White House Rose Garden. “But when you think of it  Mitch and I were saying  that has consequences 40 years out  depending on the age of the judge — but 40 years out.”
 Trump and McConnell  have succeeded in pushing judicial nominees through the Senate because the Republicans have voted in lockstep since taking control of the chamber in 2014.
When  Trump  took office in January  there were more than 100 vacant seats on the federal courts  thanks to an unprecedented slowdown engineered by McConnell during the final two years of President Obama’s term. The Senate under GOP control approved only 22 judges in that two-year period  the lowest total since 1951-52 in the last year of President Truman’s term. By contrast  the Senate under Democratic control approved 68 judges in the last two years of George W. Bush’s presidency.
The best known vacancy was on the Supreme Court. After Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016  McConnell refused to permit a hearing for Judge Merrick Garland  President Obama’s nominee.  Trump  filled the seat earlier this year with Justice Neil M. Gorsuch.
The Alliance for Justice  which tracks judicial nominees  said  Trump ’s team is off to a fast start  particularly when compared with Obama’s first year. By November 2009  Obama had made 27 judicial nominations  including Justice Sonia Sotomayor.  Trump  has nominated 59 people to the federal courts  including Justice Gorsuch. That’s also a contrast with  Trump ’s pace in filling executive branch jobs  where he has lagged far behind the pace of previous administrations.
Liberal advocates are dismayed that Republicans have voted in unison on  Trump ’s judges.","Brett J.

4789,Trump Tells Turkey's Leader: US to Stop Arming Syrian Kurds,Trump,"The United States will cut off its supply of arms to Kurdish fighters in Syria   President Donald Trump  told the Turkish president on Friday  in a move sure to please Turkey but further alienate Syrian Kurds who bore much of the fight against the Islamic State group.
In a phone call with  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan  Trump  said  he 'd ""given clear instructions"" that the Kurds will receive no more weapons — ""and that this nonsense should have ended a long time ago "" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. The White House confirmed  the move in a cryptic statement about the phone call that said Trump had informed the Turk of ""pending adjustments to the military support provided to our partners on the ground in Syria .""
The White House called  the move  ""consistent with our previous policy"" and noted the recent fall of Raqqa  once the Islamic State group's self-declared capital but recently liberated by a largely Kurdish force. The Trump administration announced in May it would start arming the Kurds in anticipation of the fight to retake Raqqa.
Cavusoglu  who said he was in the room with Erdogan during Trump's call  quoted the U.S. president as saying he had given instructions to U.S. generals and to national security adviser H.R. McMaster that ""no weapons would be issued.""
Trump's decision appeared to catch both the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department off guard. Officials at both agencies  who would normally be informed of changes in U.S. policy toward arming the Syrian Kurds  said they were unaware of any changes. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
It was unclear whether the Trump administration notified the Kurds of the move before telling the Turks.

Under questioning  Page denied three times that he had ever had a private meeting with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich.

4794,How Trump is building a border wall that no one can see,Trump,"President Trump’s  vision of a “big  beautiful” wall along the Mexican border may never be realized  and almost certainly not as a 2 000-mile physical structure spanning sea to sea.
But in a systematic and less visible way   his  administration is following a blueprint to reduce the number of foreigners living in the United States — those who are undocumented and those here legally — and overhaul the U.S. immigration system for generations to come.
 Trump administration officials  say  they  are simply upholding laws  their  predecessors did not and preserving American jobs. Previous Republican and Democratic administrations were too soft on enforcement  they say  and too rosy in their view of immigration as an unambiguously positive force.
 Bob Dane  executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform  which has pushed for many of the Trump administration’s main goals on immigration   said the president has “really scaled back this expansive view of immigration that occurred under the Obama administration.”
The new restrictions could significantly reduce the number of foreign-born workers in the U.S. labor force  but demographic experts say there is little chance they will alter the country’s broader racial and ethnic transformation  which Trump’s critics say is his goal. Census projections show the United States will no longer have a single racial or ethnic majority by mid-century  according to the Pew Research Center.
Even as they fight court orders seeking to halt parts of Trump’s immigration agenda  Sessions  White House senior adviser Stephen Miller and other key players are finding ways to shrink the immigration system. Miller was an aide to Sessions before both men joined the administration; in less than a year  their immigration policy prescriptions have moved from the realm of think-tank wish lists to White House executive orders.
Trump has endorsed GOP legislation to cut annual  legal immigration by half  reducing the number of green cards issued annually from about 1 million to 500 000. More weight would be given to immigrants with job skills  as opposed to those with extended family in the United States.
[Trump’s proposal for a ‘solar’ border wall appears to be dead]
Trump also eliminated a smaller program specifically for refugees fleeing violence in Central America. The Pentagon  citing concerns about vetting  suspended a recruitment program offering skilled foreigners a fast track to citizenship if they serve in uniform.
 Trump  is also ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  or DACA  the Obama administration program that granted work permits to 690 000 young immigrants brought here as children.  Trump’s  administration is expanding immigration courts and detention centers and has ratcheted up deportations from the interior of the United States  where millions of undocumented immigrants with U.S.-born children and no serious criminal records held little fear of expulsion under President Barack Obama.
The president and his aides have pressed forward despite an outcry from advocates and Democratic lawmakers  who in states such as California and Illinois have instructed police and public officials to shun cooperation with ICE.  The Trump administration  has threatened to strip such “sanctuary” jurisdictions of federal funding in an escalating legal standoff.
 Trump ’s tough talk alone appears to be one of  the administration’s  best bulwarks: Illegal crossings along the border with Mexico have plunged to their lowest level in 45 years  and U.S. agents are catching a far greater share of those attempting to sneak in. Applications for H-1B skilled visas and new foreign-student enrollment have also declined.
But although some of Trump’s most fervent supporters see curbing immigration as a way to turn back the United States’ rapid racial and ethnic transformation  Frey said it is an unrealistic goal. By 2020  census projections show minorities will account for more than half of the under-18 U.S. population  because of higher birthrates in nonwhite populations. And by 2026  the number of whites is projected to begin declining in absolute numbers  he said  as deaths exceed births.
 Trump  continues to insist  his  administration will build a border wall  despite exorbitant cost projections and senior DHS officials saying a 2 000-mile structure is impractical.  His  supporters say they admire the president for plowing ahead in  his  overhaul efforts and see a historic  generational shift underway.

4796,Trump Claims ' Absolute Right' To Do What He Wants To The Justice Dept. Can He ? : NPR,Trump,"Trump Claims 'Absolute Right' To Do What  He  Wants To The Justice Dept. Can  He ?
Neal Katyal wrote the special counsel regulations when he worked under President Clinton. Now he lays out the legal issues that could arise if  Trump  tries to interfere with the Mueller investigation.
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.  President Trump  has called Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation a witch hunt. Last week   Trump  told New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt  I have the absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department  implying that he can end the investigation whenever he wants. So what power does he have to stop or stymie the investigation into Russian interference in the election and any links and or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign and how consequential is Paul Manafort's lawsuit against special counsel Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Here to discuss those and other related questions is Neal Katyal who  in 1999  drafted the special counsel regulations under which Mueller was appointed. Katyal served as acting solicitor general under President Obama. He's the lead lawyer for the state of Hawaii's challenge of Trump's travel ban. He's argued many cases before the Supreme Court. In fact  that's where he'll be next week. He's a professor of law at Georgetown University and a partner in the law firm Hogan Lovells.
GROSS: So I'm going to ask you the question I'm sure you're most often asked which is  does  President Trump  have the power to fire special counsel Robert Mueller?
KATYAL: I think the answer to that is yes. And I think  he  can do it in  you know  either directly or indirectly. Some people think it can only be indirect. But I think  either way  there's a way in which it can get done. So these regulations are Justice Department regulations. They can be removed by another attorney general or an acting attorney general potentially. So the president could theoretically order Sessions to remove these regulations as a whole.
And  you know  I would love to talk about who this special counsel is  Robert Mueller and his credentials  in a moment. But let's just say you had one that - an attorney general appointed a bozo. The bozo wouldn't be able to  you know  put someone in jail. The bozo first has to work with a staff and is supervised by the acting attorney general of the United States. Now  who's the acting attorney general of the United States - the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. And who put Rod Rosenstein in power? It wasn't Barack Obama. It was  President Trump . This is - Rosenstein is  Trump 's guy. He's the guy he put there.
GROSS: So if  President Trump  asked the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire the special counsel Robert Mueller and Rosenstein refused  then  he  could - then  Trump  could fire Rosenstein  and his replacement would be asked to fire Robert Mueller and that could go on for a while. But the other possibility - or at least another possibility that  President Trump  could use would be to fire Rod Rosenstein and to replace him with somebody who would have a very favorable eye toward  President Trump . So is that a scenario that you could see playing out and working under the guidelines for the special counsel as you wrote them?
KATYAL: So it is possible for the president to try to fire Rosenstein. Rosenstein is a presidential appointee. As I say  he's  Trump 's guy  and he can be removed by  Trump . He'd have to be replaced in some way in order for the deputy attorney general to have any function. So you'd have to put someone else in place. Normally  that requires Senate confirmation to put that person in place.
And I would suspect that there would be incredible blood on the floor of the U.S. Senate - I mean  just the most divisive debate possible if someone was being confirmed to replace Rod Rosenstein who  by all accounts  has done a good job supervising the Mueller investigation. So I think  yes  there's the theoretical power that  Trump  has  but it'll be constrained by  in practice  the problem that he couldn't confirm a new person to that post.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR My guest is Neal Katyal. He drafted the regulations defining the powers of the special counsel and the limitations of those powers. So we're talking about the Robert Mueller investigation and what powers  President Trump  has to end or stymie that investigation. Neal Katyal served as the deputy solicitor general under President Obama. He's a lawyer in private practice now. But he still argues many cases before the Supreme Court.
So something that you point out  President Trump  could do is  he  could pardon everyone who's being investigated. Are you saying  he  could even pardon them before they're convicted of anything?
GROSS: So I don't know if this is outside of your view or not  but the House and the Senate have intelligence committees that are also investigating any connections between the  Trump  campaign and Russia and Russian interference in the American election. Are there things that they can do that would make it difficult for Mueller to pursue his investigation?
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross  back with Neal Katyal. In 1999  he drafted the regulations defining the powers of the special counsel under which Robert Mueller was appointed. Katyal was acting solicitor general in the Obama administration and has argued 35 cases before the Supreme Court. When we left off  we were talking about ways in which the House and Senate investigations into Russian interference in the election and links to  the Trump campaign  could actually make it more difficult for Mueller to pursue his investigation.
GROSS: Right. The two people who wrote that op-ed you're talking about  Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch of Fusion GPS  they're calling for the release of 21 hours of testimony that they gave. And they say - in that testimony  they explained how they were hired. They say the transcripts show that they suggested to the committee that the investigators look into the bank records of Deutsche Bank and others that were funding  Trump 's businesses. They write  (reading) but Congress appeared uninterested in that. Reportedly ours - the Fusion GPS - are the only bank records the House intelligence committee has subpoenaed.
Also they said that they told Congress that (reading) from Manhattan to Sunny Isles Beach  Fla.  and from Toronto to Panama  we found widespread evidence that Mr. Trump and his organization had worked with a wide array of dubious Russians in arrangements that often raised questions about money laundering. Those deals don't seem to interest Congress  they write.","[TGT]Absolute Right' To Do What  [TGT]  Wants To The Justice Dept. Can  [TGT] ?

4797,Capacity and Confusion,Trump,"Take this past week as an example. President Trump traveled to Alabama to rally for Luther Strange  who had been appointed to fill the seat left open when Jeff Sessions was appointed attorney general.
While in Alabama at the rally   Trump  also aimed a direct hit on NFL players who had knelt during the national anthem.
 Trump  said that team owners should fire any players who expressed themselves that way.  He  also suggested that  if players kneel  fans should leave the stadium.
That will have an impact   he  said. ""I guarantee  things will stop.""
On Tuesday   Trump  continued to encourage Alabama voters to vote for Strange  tweeting that  he  ""has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement.""
After Strange lost the Republican primary to Moore  earlier tweets from  Trump  praising Strange were deleted from  his  account (makes you wonder if  he  does it himself or if an aide does) and  Trump  offered  his  congratulations to Moore  with a nod to Strange. ""Congratulations to Roy Moore on his Republican Primary win in Alabama. Luther Strange started way back & ran a good race. Roy  WIN in Dec!""
Wednesday morning   Trump  moved forward tweeting  ""Spoke to Roy Moore of Alabama last night for the first time. Sounds like a really great guy who ran a fantastic race. He will help to #MAGA!""
This week  the push by the Senate GOP to repeal Obamacare has once again failed. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pulled the vote when its defeat was evident.  Trump  pivoted to  his  view that an upcoming repeal victory was in the works by tweeting on Wednesday  ""With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out)  we have the HCare Vote  but not for Friday!""
 Trump  is scheduled to go to Indiana to help sell tax reform.  He  will be joined by Sen. Joe Donnelly  D-Ind.  who will be up for reelection -- so the message will be bipartisan -- if only just a bit.","Take this past week as an example.

4798,Trump OKs 'substantially increased' sales of US military equipment to South Korea Japan,Trump,"President Trump  announced early Tuesday that  he  would allow Japan and South Korea to buy a “substantially increased” amount of sophisticated U.S. military equipment in the wake of the latest threat out of North Korea.
“I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States ”  Trump  tweeted Tuesday.
 His  message comes just one day after  he  held a call with South Korean President Moon Jae-in to discuss North Korea’s claimed test of a hydrogen bomb. According to the White House  the two leaders agreed to “maximize pressure” on North Korea by using “all means at their disposal.”
On the call Monday  the White House said   Trump  provided  his  “conceptual approval” for South Korea’s purchase of “many billions of dollars’” worth of U.S. military weapons and equipment. Though details have yet to be released  the leaders hoped to signal that the countries were working together to boost a defensive response to Kim Jong Un’s threat.
South Korea’s presidential office also said in a statement that Trump and South Korea's president agreed to remove the limit on the payload of South Korean missiles as part of the countries’ response to the North’s move.
 The president  also spoke with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday to discuss the rogue regime’s Sept. 3 bomb test.
“ President Trump  reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to defending our homeland  territories  and allies using the full range of diplomatic  conventional  and nuclear capabilities at our disposal ” the White House said in a statement Sunday after the call.
Other members in the Trump administration  like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis  warned North Korea that any threats to the U.S. or its allies would be met with an “effective and overwhelming” military response.","[TGT]announced early Tuesday that  [TGT]  would allow Japan and South Korea to buy a “substantially increased” amount of sophisticated U.S. military equipment in the wake of the latest threat out of North Korea.

4799,Frank Sinatra told Trump to go f,Trump,"When  Donald Trump  got under Frank Sinatra's skin  Old Blue Eyes told  him  to go f--- himself. Or at least  he  had  his  manager do it.
Eliot Weisman  whose book “The Way it Was ” managed Ol' Blue Eyes from 1975 to 1998. In  his  book  which come out Oct. 24   he  recounts the 1990 opening of Trump’s Taj Mahal in Atlantic City  where Sinatra had planned to perform.
Weisman said that Paul Anka warned him at Etess' funeral that he was about to learn the meaning of “The Art of the Deal ” which is the title of  Trump ’s how-to book in wheeling and dealing.
President Trump  Melania perform 'painful' first inaugural dance
According to  Weisman  Trump  started off the new negotiations by saying that the cost for the 12 dates Sinatra was slated to perform was “a little rich.” The Donald also decided he didn’t need to book the other acts that were part of the original deal  including Sammy Davis Jr.  who’d just been diagnosed with cancer  and Steve and Eydie.
“Who’s Steve and Eydie?”  Trump  asked  according to Weisman. Weisman says he then tried choking The Donald by his tie  but his son  who was also at the meeting  restrained him.
Weisman called Sinatra to tell him what had happened  and Sinatra told him he had two choices: to tell  Trump  to go f--k himself or give  Trump’s  phone number to Sinatra so that he could do it himself. Weisman returned to  Trump ’s office and told The Donald “Sinatra says go f--k yourself!”
The deal never happened and Sinatra ended up playing at the Sands in Las Vegas. Much to Weisman's surprise  when  Trump  opened Mar-a-Lago   his  office called  him  out of the blue because they needed an opening day act.  He  offered Don Rickles  along with Steve and Eydie.  Trump  accepted.

President Trump and Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway speak during a press conference at the White House Wednesday. (Photo: Mark Wilson  Getty Images)
WASHINGTON — The United States ""could conceivably go back in"" to the Paris climate agreement   President Trump  said Wednesday — but it would have to be under terms that don't punish the country for its wealth of fossil fuels.
""Frankly  it's an agreement that I have no problem with  but I had a problem with the agreement that they signed  because  as usual  they made a bad deal ""  Trump  said.
 His  comments came during a joint press conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg at the White House. Norway  rich in Arctic oil and gas reserves  was the first developed nation to ratify the global agreement to reduce carbon emissions. The United States also joined the non-binding agreement under President Barack Obama  but  Trump  said last year  he  was withdrawing.
 Trump  said the issue came up in  his  private talks with Solberg  but ""it wasn't a major topic.""
During the press conference  Solberg impressed upon  Trump  the business opportunities in renewable energy. ""We have strict regulations to meet our Paris targets  which means we have very strong policies for environment-friendly and climate-friendly technologies "" she said.
 Trump  spoke glowingly of Norway's renewable energy. ""Norway has tremendous hydro power. Tremendous ""  he  said. ""I wish we'd do some of that  but hydro power is fantastic  and it's a great asset that you have.""
But earlier  while speaking about U.S. energy dominance over Russia   he  also derided  his  former rival  Hillary Clinton  for her energy policies.
""I am for massive oil and gas and everything else  and a lot of energy ""  he  said. ""Hillary  my opponent  was for windmills  and she was for other types of energy that don't have the same capacities at this moment certainly.""

4803,Trump offered a grieving military father $25 000 in a phone call,Trump,"President  Trump   in a personal phone call to a grieving military father  offered  him  $25 000 and said  he  would direct  his  staff to establish an online fundraiser for the family  but neither happened  the father said.
Chris Baldridge  the father of Army Sgt. Dillon Baldridge  said that  Trump  called him at his home in Zebulon  N.C.  a few weeks after his 22-year-old son and two fellow soldiers were fatally shot by an Afghan police officer on June 10. Their phone conversation lasted about 15 minutes  Baldridge said  and centered for a time on the father’s struggle with the manner in which his son was killed — shot by someone he was training.

 Trump  said this week that  he  has “called every family of somebody that’s died  and it’s the hardest call to make.” At least 20 Americans have been killed in action since he became commander in chief in January. The Post interviewed the families of 13. About half had received phone calls  they said. The others said they had not heard from the president.
In his call with  Trump   Baldridge  a construction worker  expressed frustration with the military’s survivor benefits program. Because  his  ex-wife was listed as their son’s beneficiary  she was expected to receive the Pentagon’s $100 000 death gratuity — even though “I can barely rub two nickels together ”  he  told  Trump .

The president has been on the defensive since details emerged of his phone call Tuesday with the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson  who was killed Oct. 4 along with three other U.S. soldiers in Niger. After not addressing the incident for 12 days   Trump  on Monday falsely claimed that previous presidents never or rarely called the families of fallen service members. In fact  they did so regularly.

Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) said  Trump  called Johnson’s widow  Myeshia Johnson  on Tuesday and said her husband “knew what he was signing up for  but I guess it hurts anyway.” Wilson was riding in a limousine with the widow and said she heard the conversation on speakerphone.
 Trump  denied the allegation Wednesday  saying in a tweet that Wilson had “totally fabricated” what happened and that he had “proof.” But the soldier’s childhood guardian  Cowanda Jones-Johnson  told The Post that she also was in the car when  Trump  called  and said that  “President Trump  did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband.”
 Trump  later expanded  his  denial  saying that  he  did not say what Wilson alleged and that “she knows it.”
 He  added: “I had a very nice conversation with the woman  with the wife who was — sounded like a lovely woman. Did not say what the congresswoman said  and most people aren’t too surprised to hear that.”

It turns out that electing  President Trump  was not the apex of Republicans’ political insanity. Since last November  consider the Trump GOP’s track record:
The GOP’s environmental agenda includes climate-change denial (despite the government’s own confirmation that climate change is real and man-made)  lifting the ban on importing elephant trophies (the first sons are avid big-game hunters and Christmas is around the corner) and trying in vain to save the coal industry. Trump’s GOP has made China look like a leader in global environmental issues.
The GOP’s constitutional conservatism amounts to giving a totally unqualified nominee who hid a conflict of interest a lifetime federal court appointment. (The Post reports: “ Brett J. Talley  the young lawyer nominated by President Trump for a lifetime federal judgeship in Alabama   was asked by a Senate committee to disclose family members who are likely to present potential conflicts of interest if  he  is confirmed. …  He  did not  however  identify any family members — including  his  wife  who is one of President Trump’s attorneys. Annie Donaldson is White House Counsel Donald McGahn’s chief of staff.”)  He ’s actually one of four nominees rated “unqualified” by the American Bar Association.

 The Trump GOP  does not believe in fiscal responsibility nor in federalism (as evidenced by  its  attack on localities that don’t do the feds’ bidding on immigration enforcement) nor in legal immigration. It does  however  believe in mass deportation of “dreamers ” who came here illegally as children.
 The GOP president  believes 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally based on no evidence whatsoever but doesn’t think the Russians meddled in our election despite the unanimous findings of our intelligence services.
 The GOP president  does not believe the media should be able to write whatever it wants nor that a sheriff found in contempt of court for abusing the rights of suspected illegal immigrants should be convicted and punished.
The GOP-led Congress is content to tolerate Trump’s nepotism  massive conflicts of interest and possible receipt of foreign emoluments. It looks the other way as a president monetizes the office  hawking his properties at every opportunity.","[TGT]speaks during a meeting on tax policy with Republican lawmakers in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington on Nov. 2.

4805,Trump urged by top advisers to waive Iran sanctions: official,Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Donald Trump  is being urged by some top advisers not to bring back U.S. economic sanctions on Iran this week  a move by the president that would effectively end a 2015 deal to limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
Two senior administration official told Reuters on Wednesday that  Trump’s  top advisers were recommending that  he  not reimpose sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the agreement between Iran  the United States and other world powers.
But  Trump  who has previously vowed to scrap the nuclear pact   is privately expressing reluctance to heed  the advisers   the officials said.
 Trump  will seek to make a final decision on the sanctions during a meeting with national security aides on Thursday  the senior officials said.
If  Trump  did waive the sanctions  one official said  the administration would nevertheless impose new  targeted measure on Iranian businesses and people.
A third U.S. official said  Trump  was expected by some officials to renew the sanctions waivers but stressed that no final decision had been made.
 Trump  has gnashed  his  teeth at having to waive the sanctions again  believing  his  predecessor  Democratic President Barack Obama  negotiated a bad deal for the United States in agreeing to the accord  known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
 Trump  in October chose not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal and warned  he  might ultimately terminate it.  He  accused Iran of “not living up to the spirit” of the nuclear agreement even though the International Atomic Energy Agency says Tehran is in fact in compliance.
But some liberal Democrats who support the deal want to pass legislation that would make it harder for  Trump  to pull Washington out without congressional consent.
 Trump  and  his  top advisers have been negotiating with U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill to try to change sanctions legislation so that  he  does not face a deadline on whether to recertify Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal every 90 days.
Corker told Reuters that if  Trump  does not listen to  his  team  and pulls the United States out  there is no point in pursuing the legislation.
“But most of the general view around  him   with  his  team  with all of  his  foreign policy leaders   his  cabinet members  is I think hoping that  he ’ll continue to waive sanctions and to try to support what  his  team has been working with us on for eight or nine months ” Corker said.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  [TGT]is being urged by some top advisers not to bring back U.S. economic sanctions on Iran this week  a move by the president that would effectively end a 2015 deal to limit Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.

Hours after a controversial memo was released Saturday as a rebuttal to serious allegations about the FBI   President Trump  called into Fox News and said  he  felt the document ""was a nothing"" and merely verified allegations that the FBI had abused its power.
""It was a nothing ""  he  told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. ""That was really just a confirmation of  if you call it the Republican memo or the Nunes memo  it's referred to as a lot of things  but that was nothing but a confirmation.""
 Trump  spent several hours watching — and tweeting about — Fox News before calling into “Justice with Judge Jeanine"" and talking about a number of topics  including a possible military parade and  his  call for tighter gun laws following the Feb. 14 shooting at a Florida high school.
The memo  compiled by Rep. Adam Schiff  the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee  attempted to outline mischaracterizations and omissions from another memo released by committee Republicans earlier this month. Republicans  in their memo  accused the FBI of obtaining a FISA surveillance warrant to spy on former  Trump  campaign aide Carter Page by using information in a controversial dossier by former British spy Christopher Steele  which was funded by Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
While talking about  the memo  Trump  blasted Schiff  calling him a ""bad guy"" and suggested that the California Democrat might be breaking the law and leaking information to reporters.
He then said  the memo  verifies that the ""other side"" did ""fraudulent"" things and should be investigated.
Then   Trump  called for the country to come together as one.
Pirro asked  Trump  about gun-control laws and a possible military parade in Washington  D.C.

4810,In private remarks  Trump opines on North Korea Afghanistan and catapults,Trump,"President Trump  offers a toast during the annual Governors’ Dinner at the White House on Feb. 26. (Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)
 President Trump  shared  his  insights on Kim Jong Un  terrorists in Afghanistan and the Navy’s plan to upgrade its catapult system on aircraft carriers in private remarks Tuesday night to a group of high-dollar donors.
Over lengthy remarks   the president  recalled how  he  came to reverse course on deploying troops to Afghanistan  calling that country “the Wharton school of finance for terrorists ” referring to  his  alma mater.  Trump  also praised  his  own handling of the North Korea nuclear crisis  touted  his  relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and explained how  he  came up with  his  latest nickname for Kim Jong Un.
Although  Trump  called Kim “ Rocket Man ” in his first address to the United Nations  he thought it was not an insult and could even be seen as a compliment   Trump  said at the dinner  according to attendees. But after Kim issued a statement calling  Trump  a “dotard ”  Trump  upped the ante.
“So I said  all right  so now I’ll call him Little Rocket Man ”  Trump  said.
Attendees passed along remarks  Trump  made on various foreign policy issues around the world.

Republicans worry that their last best hope for a legislative win  a tax overhaul  could fall victim to the scandal. And  the president’s  denial that  his  campaign worked in any way with Russia continues to be tested by new disclosures.
The only person with any significant control over events  special counsel Robert S. Mueller III  offered no hints Monday on his next move beyond the day’s bombshells — legal filings that included the indictment of two former Trump campaign officials and the guilty plea of a third.
 President Trump 's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort  Manafort's former business associate Rick Gates and  Trump  campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have all been charged in the special counsel's investigation into Russian election interference. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
The release of the charges followed the disclosure last week that a prominent Democratic lawyer and a news outlet backed by a major Republican donor had at different times paid a firm that compiled opposition research on Trump alleging ties to Russian interests that could threaten national security.
“The charges brought last week could easily result in prosecutions extending into 2019  just on the trial level  not even the appellate level ” said Jonathan Turley  a law professor at George Washington University Law School. “That is going to continue to have a dysfunctional impact on the Trump administration.”
Even the president found himself caught off guard when he prematurely tweeted his own absolution hours after indictments were announced against his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a top deputy  Rick Gates. At 10:25 a.m.   Trump  felt it safe to boast that the announcements did not directly reference  his  campaign.
“Sorry  but this is years ago  before Paul Manafort was part of the campaign ”  Trump  wrote on Twitter. “. . . Also  there is NO COLLUSION!”
Minutes later  Mueller’s team announced a previously secret guilty plea of a third  Trump  campaign adviser  George Papadopoulos  who worked on foreign policy in a volunteer capacity. In court papers  Papadopoulos described in detail his 2016 efforts to arrange contacts with people he knew to be Russian agents  including one person who had told him about Russian “dirt” on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton  including “thousands of emails.”
Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to giving false statements to federal agents in his initial interviews about the interactions. He now says that he discussed the Russian overtures he had received with several other people in the Trump campaign  including a “senior policy adviser ” a “campaign supervisor” and a “high-ranking campaign official.” Among the campaign officials he emailed were Manafort  campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and national campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis.

4820,Russia probe marked by contrasting styles of Trump and Mueller,Trump,"The main protagonists of the Russia probe stayed largely out of public view on Monday.  President Trump  surfaced only late in the day for a White House trick-or-treating event  while special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was invisible apart from the signature  he  affixed to the indictment that was unsealed.
 Trump  has often treated the probe as a political assault to be met with counterattacks in both public and private  rather than a legal minefield to be navigated carefully.  He  has fired  his  former FBI director  lashed out frequently on social media  shuffled teams of lawyers and called for the prosecution of Democrats — all part of a highly public but so far unsuccessful attempt to derail the investigation.
[It’s not clear where  Mueller ’s next bombshell will land. And that has Washington on edge.]
Mueller  by contrast  has been silently methodical. He has not uttered a single word in public  works from an undisclosed location in Southwest Washington and demonstrated the same discipline and disdain for theatrics that defined his 12-year tenure as FBI director. Submarine-like in approach  Mueller has remained entirely below the surface except when delivering legal strikes that have included the raid of former  Trump  campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s home and the indictments this week.
“Mueller is the opposite of  Trump   the opposite of a showman  opposite of blustery ” said Jack Goldsmith  who served as a senior Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration. Mueller “is very quiet  very circumspect  very disciplined ” Goldsmith said. “But he spoke very loudly and very powerfully” through the indictments of Manafort and his longtime business partner Rick Gates as well as the guilty plea of former  Trump  foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that were disclosed on Monday.
The president’s defenders remain convinced he will be vindicated  and that Mueller’s investigation will fail to find evidence that the  Trump  campaign colluded with Russia as part of a Kremlin interference campaign that  according to a report by U.S. intelligence agencies  sought to discredit the 2016 U.S. election and help propel  Trump  to victory.
“Here we are and it’s November  11 or 12 months into this thing  and still no evidence that  Trump  did anything ” said  Barry Bennett  a former campaign adviser to Trump . “I don’t think  Trump  even sees [Mueller] as an adversary.”
If  Trump  at times seems unconcerned with the extent to which  his  statements and actions complicate  his  legal position   Bennett  said  it is because  he  sees  himself  as innocent and “doesn’t even understand why we’re engaged in this process.”
One of  Trump ’s lawyers  Ty Cobb  said Monday that Mueller’s moves had “not been a cause of great agita or angst or activity at the White House.”
But the statement was belied by  Trump ’s own behavior  according to those close to  him  who said  he  spent much of Monday fuming over media coverage and venting to subordinates.  He  also lashed out in a series of posts on Twitter  saying Tuesday that the “Fake News is working overtime ” and that Papadopoulos — an adviser  Trump  once praised as “an excellent guy” — was “proven to be a liar.”

The predictably rapid leak of details about  Trump ’s reaction from inside the White House only highlighted the contrast with Mueller  whose legal team has a lock on the progress of the probe. CNN reported on an indictment Friday night  but there were no reports that it was Manafort and Gates until just hours before it was unsealed. Nothing leaked on the plea and cooperation of Papadopoulos until Mueller chose to disclose it.
Mueller’s refusal to engage publicly sets him apart from other legal and political adversaries that  Trump  has encountered since his entry into politics.  Trump’s  combative impulses are often most effective when  he  can draw opponents into a public skirmish  whether on a crowded debate stage during the Republican primaries or in social media showdowns with members of  his  own party  including most recently Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)
 Trump  has  at times  sought to pressure key players in the Russia probe.  He  pressed former FBI director James B. Comey for an oath of loyalty before firing him in frustration as the inquiry expanded. More recently   Trump  publicly berated Attorney General Jeff Sessions over  his  decision to recuse  himself  from matters related to the Russia probe  a decision that cleared the way for installing Mueller as special counsel.
Former associates of Mueller said his stealth approach reflects long-standing views of prosecutorial conduct  but also has the strategic advantage of unnerving targets of investigations  a list that may include  Trump .
“The net effect of having these two powerful actions in court [Monday] combined with the mystery that has surrounded the investigation up until today has set everyone in  Trump  world on edge ” said Matthew Miller  who served as Justice Department spokesman during the Obama administration.","The main protagonists of the Russia probe stayed largely out of public view on Monday.  [TGT]surfaced only late in the day for a White House trick-or-treating event  while special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was invisible apart from the signature  [TGT]  affixed to the indictment that was unsealed.
 [TGT]has often treated the probe as a political assault to be met with counterattacks in both public and private  rather than a legal minefield to be navigated carefully.  [TGT]  has fired  [TGT]  former FBI director  lashed out frequently on social media  shuffled teams of lawyers and called for the prosecution of Democrats — all part of a highly public but so far unsuccessful attempt to derail the investigation.
[It’s not clear where  Mueller ’s next bombshell will land. And that has Washington on edge.]
Mueller  by contrast  has been silently methodical. He has not uttered a single word in public  works from an undisclosed location in Southwest Washington and demonstrated the same discipline and disdain for theatrics that defined his 12-year tenure as FBI director. Submarine-like in approach  Mueller has remained entirely below the surface except when delivering legal strikes that have included the raid of former  [TGT]campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s home and the indictments this week.

4821,AP FACT CHECK: Trump vastly overstates depth of labor pool,Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As  he  envisions a manufacturing revival   President Donald Trump  is telling lawmakers the U.S. has a vast  idle labor pool itching to go to work. That’s a mirage.
 His  remarks Tuesday at a meeting with members of Congress about trade:
Out of  Trump’s  pool of 100 million (actually 95.7 million  according to the government)  only about 5.2 million say they want to be working. The vast majority is made up of students aged 16 and over  the elderly and people who want to stay home to raise their children. That information comes from the same government survey used to calculate the unemployment rate.
The economy is already considered to be close to full employment  meaning it’s harder to find workers to fill new jobs — harder still if  Trump  succeeds in curbing immigration.
Few economists blame social programs keeping large numbers of people at home and out of work  as  Trump  appeared to do. Instead  recent economic research suggests opioid addiction is a key reason many Americans can’t get or keep jobs. And past episodes of widespread imprisonment are also a factor: Having a criminal conviction makes it hard for people to find work once they are out of jail.
Trump reasons that trade penalties he’s considering against other countries would spur domestic manufacturing if imports become too expensive. But Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and other lawmakers told him to tread carefully on trade sanctions because the tight U.S. labor market has existing manufacturers struggling to fill jobs.","WASHINGTON (AP) — As  he  envisions [TGT]is telling lawmakers the U.S. has a vast  idle labor pool itching to go to work.

4823,Articles: Jimmy Kimmel Lies about Trump Guns and the Mentally Ill,Trump,"There is a delicious sense of irony in gun-control advocate Jimmy Kimmel beefing up his armed security after falsely claiming on his late-night talk show after the Las Vegas massacre that President Trump had made it easier for the mentally ill to get guns. Guns are okay to protect the liberal elites  but not for the rest of us  who can’t be trusted or don’t know any better.
Dr. Kimmel has no way of knowing even now that the Las Vegas shooter was mentally unstable. Certainly the meticulous planning and preparation by the shooter over a long period of time would seem to indicate that while the shooter was evil  he was perfectly competent and sane. Certainly Kimmel’s charge against  Trump  is not true: Noting that  President Trump  had offered prayers for the victims’ families  and that Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the White House press secretary  had said that this wasn’t the time for political debate   he  went on: “We have fifty-nine innocent people dead. It wasn’t their time  either. So I think now is the time for political debate.”  He  reminded  his  audience that  in February  Trump had signed a bill that made it easier for people with mental illness to buy guns. “The Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell  the Speaker of the House  Paul Ryan  a number of other lawmakers who won’t do anything about this because the N.R.A. has their balls in a money clip  also sent their thoughts and their prayers today. Which is good. They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.”
What  President Trump  signed was a bill overturning an executive order that would tar the innocent with the broad brush of mental illness  people which included the elderly and veterans  in order to pursue the Obama administration’s gun control agenda:

4824,Trade Globalists in White House Fail to Stop Trump's 'America First' Tariffs,Trump,"The trade globalist wing of the White House has failed in its efforts to stop  President Trump  from following through on  his  promise to protect American industries and jobs by imposing tariffs on imported foreign products.
On Thursday  the White House announced that  Trump  is set to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a ten percent tariff on imported aluminum. The move follows through on  Trump ’s commitment to voters that  he  would be “tough” on China  which has been accused of dumping cheap foreign products in the U.S.  undermining the country’s manufacturing base.
White House adviser Gary Cohn  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  and Defense Secretary James Mattis attempted but failed to stop  Trump  from imposing the steel and aluminum tariffs.
Cohn and Mnuchin — the West Wing’s biggest proponents of free trade — tried to get  Trump  to water down  his  actions against China and on trade  in general  as Breitbart News reported.
The two trade globalists are so opposed to the tariffs sought by  Trump  and  his  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that White House officials were allegedly telling the media that an announcement on trade was canceled.

Trump loyalist and adviser Corey Lewandowski told Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM 125 The Patriot Channel this past weekend that he believed the president would be moving in this direction with trade  noting that it boils down to bringing manufacturing jobs  which were decimated and outsourced through various free trade agreements  back to the country.","The trade globalist wing of the White House has failed in its efforts to stop  [TGT]from following through on  [TGT]  promise to protect American industries and jobs by imposing tariffs on imported foreign products.

4825,Trump hopes 'something good' comes from Olympics despite North Korean warning,Trump,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  expressed hope on Friday that “something good” could come from North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics in South Korea  even after Pyongyang warned it would not “sit idle” if Washington and Seoul resumed military exercises after the Games.
Trump met North Korean defectors at the White House on Friday and said the Olympics could serve as an indicator as to whether the crisis over North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons capable of hitting the United States could be resolved.
“It’s a very tricky situation ”  Trump  told reporters. “We’re going to find out how it goes. We think the Olympics will go very nicely and after that  who knows.”
 He  said  he  was not trying to send a message to North Korea by meeting the defectors. “They were here and I said ‘let’s tell your story’.”
Asked if there was more Washington could do to resolve the problem   Trump  said  his  administration was doing a lot but  its  options were limited given concessions by previous presidents.
“We ran out of road ”  he  said. “We have no road left. So we’ll see what happens  but in the meantime  we’ll get through the Olympics and maybe something good can come out of the Olympics. Who knows?”
 Trump’s  administration has warned that all options are on the table  including military ones  to resolve the crisis.
While  it  has repeatedly said  it  prefers a diplomatic solution   Trump  has exchanged threats with Kim and U.S. officials have said the president and  his  advisers have discussed a preventative “bloody nose” strike on North Korea  alarming experts who warn that this could trigger catastrophic retaliation  especially on South Korea.
U.S. officials have said the debate on military action has lost some momentum as a result of the intra-Korean talks  which  Trump  has called a “good thing” and credited to  his  tough stance.
The White House said on Friday that  Trump  and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke by telephone and discussed an expanded missile defense system and other efforts to boost Japan’s defenses amid the tensions over North Korea.
 Trump  also spoke to South Korean President Moon Jae-in about human rights in North Korea and trade between the United States and South Korea  the White House said.","WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) [TGT]expressed hope on Friday that “something good” could come from North Korea’s participation in the Winter Olympics in South Korea  even after Pyongyang warned it would not “sit idle” if Washington and Seoul resumed military exercises after the Games.

4827,Trump Offers Blueprint For Military And Foreign Policy : NPR,Trump,"Trump Offers Blueprint For Military And  Foreign Policy
President Trump  outlines  his  national security priorities on paper  as is required by Congress. The document  known as a national security strategy  identifies challenges the U.S. faces overseas.
 ARI SHAPIRO  HOST:
President Trump  unveiled  his  national security strategy today. It's a blueprint for confronting international challenges ranging from terrorism to cyber warfare. Congress requires presidents to issue such a strategy. It has often been done quietly  but this president took the opportunity to trumpet his approach. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.
SCOTT HORSLEY  BYLINE: In  Trump 's telling  the United States has squandered much of the last three decades from the fall of the Berlin Wall until his own election a year ago  complacent in its superpower status even as rivals were chipping away at America's lead.  Trump 's new national security strategy declares that approach is over.
 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Whether we like it or not  we are engaged in a new era of competition. We accept that vigorous military  economic and political contests are now playing out all around the world.
HORSLEY:  Trump  says the U.S. will no longer assume that engaging other countries  trading with them and bringing them into the international fold will eventually tame those rivalries. Instead   he  says   he 's embracing the international competition head-on.
HORSLEY: Trump's strategy identifies three main categories of adversaries - transnational gangs of terrorists and criminals  rogue states like North Korea and what the White House calls revisionist powers such as China and Russia. That doesn't rule out cooperation with those countries. But despite his oft-stated wish for improved ties with Russia  Trump says the U.S. is clear-eyed about the limits of that relationship.
HORSLEY: Trump says the U.S. will carry out its strategy on a number of fronts from protecting the homeland to boosting America's economy.
HORSLEY: While the security strategy nods to  Trump 's slogan of America First  aides insist that should not be read as isolationism. On the contrary  they say  Trump  wants to boost America's influence overseas. Foreign policy analyst Dan Drezner of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy says there's not much sign of that in the last year.
HORSLEY: Drezner says by bucking international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord   Trump  has prompted other countries to look past the U.S. In some cases  competitors like China have stepped in to fill the void. On his trip to Asia last month   Trump  celebrated his red carpet welcome as a sign of respect for America  but Drezner suspects it's really a way of playing to the president's ego.
DREZNER: For  Trump   foreign policy is personalized. If he is treated well  he interprets that as American and American interests being treated well even though that's not necessarily the case.
HORSLEY:  Trump 's strategy no longer treats global climate change as a national security threat.

President Trump  outlines  his  national security priorities on paper  as is required by Congress. The document  known as a national security strategy  identifies challenges the U.S. faces overseas.
 ARI SHAPIRO  HOST:
[TGT]unveiled  [TGT]  national security strategy today. It's a blueprint for confronting international challenges ranging from terrorism to cyber warfare. Congress requires presidents to issue such a strategy. It has often been done quietly  but [TGT] took the opportunity to trumpet [TGT] approach. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.
SCOTT HORSLEY  BYLINE: In  [TGT] 's telling  the United States has squandered much of the last three decades from the fall of the Berlin Wall until [TGT] own election a year ago  complacent in its superpower status even as rivals were chipping away at America's lead.  [TGT] 's new national security strategy declares that approach is over.
 [TGT] : Whether we like it or not  we are engaged in a new era of competition. We accept that vigorous military  economic and political contests are now playing out all around the world.
HORSLEY:  [TGT]says the U.S. will no longer assume that engaging other countries  trading with them and bringing them into the international fold will eventually tame those rivalries. Instead   he  says   he 's embracing the international competition head-on.
HORSLEY: [TGT]'s strategy identifies three main categories of adversaries - transnational gangs of terrorists and criminals  rogue states like North Korea and what the White House calls revisionist powers such as China and Russia. That doesn't rule out cooperation with those countries. But despite his oft-stated wish for improved ties with Russia  [TGT] says the U.S. is clear-eyed about the limits of that relationship.
HORSLEY: [TGT] says the U.S. will carry out [TGT] strategy on a number of fronts from protecting the homeland to boosting America's economy.
HORSLEY: While the security strategy nods to  [TGT] 's slogan of America First  aides insist that should not be read as isolationism. On the contrary  they say  [TGT]  wants to boost America's influence overseas. Foreign policy analyst Dan Drezner of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy says there's not much sign of that in the last year.
HORSLEY: Drezner says by bucking international agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accord   [TGT]has prompted other countries to look past the U.S. In some cases  competitors like China have stepped in to fill the void. On his trip to Asia last month   [TGT]celebrated his red carpet welcome as a sign of respect for America  but Drezner suspects it's really a way of playing to the president's ego.
DREZNER: For  Trump   foreign policy is personalized. If he is treated well  he interprets that as American and American interests being treated well even though that's not necessarily the case.
HORSLEY:  [TGT] 's strategy no longer treats global climate change as a national security threat. Instead   [TGT]  calls for unleashing America's abundant energy resources as a way to boost the U.S. economy.

4828,Trump sticks to somber script in wake of Las Vegas shooting refuses to join guns debate,Trump,"President Donald Trump  stuck to a somber script Monday after at least 59 people were shot dead in Las Vegas  condemning the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history as an ""act of pure evil"" and declaring the nation would unite behind the survivors.  He  refused to get into a new debate over gun control.
Faced with the sad and familiar ritual of a president offering consolation after horrific violence  Trump spoke slowly and carefully from the White House Diplomatic Room  focusing not on the identity or possible motive of the shooter but on the nation's efforts to heal.
Trump spoke hours after a gunman on the 32nd floor of a Vegas Strip casino opened fire on people at an outdoor country music festival below. The gunman  64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock  killed at least 59 people as tens of thousands of concertgoers screamed and ran for their lives. More than 500 people were hurt.
In a measured statement that was revised by aides until moments before he spoke  Trump did not describe the gunman in any way or suggest what might have been behind his actions. He praised the first responders who he said prevented further loss of life and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. He offered condolences to the families of those killed  saying  ""We cannot fathom their pain. We cannot imagine their loss.""
 Trump  who owns a hotel in Las Vegas   told associates that  he  feels deep ties to the city.  He  said in public that  his  visit would be ""a very  very sad moment for  me  ... for everybody no matter where you are  no matter what your thought process.""
 The president  was informed of the shooting early Monday by chief of staff John Kelly  according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. He received periodic briefings from Kelly and homeland security adviser Tom Bossert while also monitoring the coverage on cable news. On Twitter  he avoided the kind of inflammatory statements he has issued after some previous tragedies  such as last year's Orlando nightclub shooting  instead offering ""warmest condolences"" to victims and their families.
Like presidents before him   Trump  marked the events by ordering the American flags at all public buildings across the nation flown at half-staff  and  he  observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn. Unlike  his  predecessor  Barack Obama  who responded to mass shootings by calling for stricter gun control measures   Trump  made no mention of firearms restrictions.
Before he was a candidate   Trump at one point  favored some gun restrictions. He has more recently cast himself as an ardent protector of the Second Amendment. Though Sanders did not dismiss a question about the potential for a bipartisan effort on guns  raising the possibility that  Trump  might be willing to cross the aisle and work with Democratic leaders  the president has proclaimed that if more ""good guys"" were armed with firearms  there would be fewer gun tragedies.
 Trump 's trip to Las Vegas will come a day after  he  visits hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico  where many have accused the federal government of an inadequate response. Vice President Mike Pence is still scheduled to attend a tax legislation event and fundraiser in Phoenix on Tuesday.
The president also offered a somber response in June  after a shooting at a congressional baseball practice that wounded five  including Republican Rep. Steve Scalise. But  Trump  has drawn criticism for more inflammatory and self-referential reactions to other acts of violence.
After the Orlando shootings at a gay nightclub that left 49 dead   he  tweeted  ""Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism."" In the wake of a deadly terror attack in London in June   he  went after the city's mayor on Twitter  suggesting  he  wasn't taking the attacks seriously enough.","[TGT]stuck to a somber script Monday after at least 59 people were shot dead in Las Vegas  condemning the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history as an ""act of pure evil"" and declaring the nation would unite behind the survivors.

4831,After Trump clears the way GOP states move to charge poor more for Medicaid,Trump,"The  Trump  administration is giving states the green light to increase premiums on enrollees in Medicaid  the nation's health insurance program for the poor. (David Goldman/AP)
Indiana is at the leading edge of Republican efforts to shift Medicaid in a more conservative direction — with  the Trump administration  giving the green light to states to shift some of the burden for the program onto the poor.
Indiana began asking the destitute to pay a monthly premium for some Medicaid services in 2015  as part of a deal with  the Obama administration  to expand the program. But more recent moves by Kentucky  Maine and Wisconsin seeking to ramp up patients' payments do not include a goal of expanding the 53-year-old program.
Last month   the Trump administration  approved Kentucky’s petition to raise premiums and impose work requirements for Medicaid. Earlier this month   the administration  approved Indiana's plan to raise premiums for poor people who smoke tobacco.
The new Medicaid premiums come at a time when the Trump administration is seeking to overhaul the social safety net. Conservatives say the changes  which give poor people additional responsibilities for obtaining government benefits  will encourage them to join the workforce.
Critics say the requirements will push more people into poverty. The Trump administration also plans on unveiling legislation to create work requirements for public housing programs  and recently called for transforming the nation's food assistance program.
“A big part of the rationale behind what they're doing is the idea that these people are not intended to be beneficiaries of Medicaid  despite the law saying that they are ” said Judith Solomon  a health policy expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “This is part of an overall agenda  as evidenced by the budget and elsewhere in the Trump administration  that would take away health care and food and rental assistance including for working families. All these pieces go together.”
[ Trump  wants to overhaul America’s safety net with giant cuts to housing  food stamps and health care]
In an email   Trump  officials said that allowing states to increase premiums for Medicaid enrollees would lead to more “responsible decision-making.”
But now some states are pursuing costlier premiums than what the Obama administration permitted  or introducing penalties for failing to pay those premiums  according to MaryBeth Musumeci  associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation. And unlike prior administrations   Trump  is poised to permit states to enact premiums without also guaranteeing they expand coverage in exchange.
But after Republicans in Congress failed last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act   the Trump administration  dropped the requirement for expanding coverage when considering states' proposals for overhauling Medicaid.
“We will not just accept the hollow victory of numbers covered ” said Seema Verma  Trump's administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  at the time.
In North Dakota  meanwhile  lawmakers told The Washington Post they will consider adding new premiums in light of  the Trump administration 's recent approval of Kentucky's plan.
Conservative supporters of the policies say they encourage the poor to take responsibility for their health. “There needs to be some skin in the game ” said state Sen. Judy E. Lee (R)  chair of the North Dakota state senate's health services committee. “There’s a difference to how people respond when they might have to pay $2 to $3  and the flexibility we’re seeing from the  Trump  administration is very important.”
“This is a big part of the Trump administration’s war on Medicaid ” said Ari Ne'eman  who served on the National Council on Disability under President Obama. “We are talking about populations of people  many of whom are facing significant challenges associated with poverty  and adding an additional administrative burden is needlessly cruel and offers no meaningful policy rationale.”

4834,A new Trump administration plan makes nuclear war likelier,Trump,"The Trump administration’s wizards of Armageddon  have locked down  their  vision of the nuclear future.  It  is  by and large  a rehash of old thinking from previous administrations  but  its  one key departure is a doozy: It declares a newfound readiness to use U.S. nuclear weapons first and early in a confrontation with Russia and possibly others.
[No one can stop President Trump from using nuclear weapons. That’s by design.]
Russia developed this doctrine over the past five years partially to exploit growing infrastructure vulnerabilities stemming from growing Western dependencies on these networks  and partially to reduce Russia’s own strategic reliance on first use of nuclear arms. By focusing on cyberwar and conventional forces  Russia seeks to depend less on its 20-year-old doctrine of “escalate to de-escalate ” which calls for the early first use of small-yield Russian tactical nuclear weapons to counter Western conventional supremacy. (This Russian option is also cited by the Trump review as a reason for acquiring and using countervailing low-yield U.S. nuclear weapons.)
The West’s Achilles’ heel of infrastructure vulnerability may tempt other adversaries besides Russia to take aim at this weakness in wartime. Indeed  the Trump administration’s document leaves the door ajar for possible U.S. nuclear first strikes against non-nuclear countries if they wreck our critical civilian infrastructure.
The burden of nuclear first use should remain on Russia and not be allowed to shift onto NATO. No American president wants to feel pressure to authorize the early first use of nuclear weapons. The correct approach is for the West to exploit its own cyber and conventional prowess to counter Russia on its own terms  exploiting Western superiority in these areas and leaving the burden of nuclear first use on Russia’s shoulders. We need tighter  not looser rules for using nukes first in a confrontation with Russia.  President Trump  should expunge this major new creative  but misguided  part of  his  nuclear review — and fire  its  authors.

Visitors to Steyer’s new website see a compilation of news articles about  Trump ’s decisions  and a long open letter from Steyer  with a litany of reasons for politicians to remove  Trump  from office. Finally  there is an offer to sign up with the campaign.
“ He  is repealing clean air protections and unleashing polluters  even as increasingly catastrophic natural disasters supercharged by our warming planet ravaged the country throughout the summer ” Steyer writes. “ He  has threatened to reduce aid for millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico who are struggling to survive without drinkable water or electricity — a move that would be a total dereliction of  his  duty. And every day  Americans are left bracing for a Twitter screed that could set off a nuclear war.”
In the House  Reps. Al Green (D-Tex.) and Brad Sherman (D-Calif.)  two backbenchers from safe seats  have introduced articles of impeachment with no real hope of being adopted. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi  who once fended off liberal demands that her party impeach President George W.

Last Sunday  the publisher of Hustler magazine  Larry Flynt  put a full-page ad in The Washington Post offering $10 million for information leading to  [TGT] ’s “impeachment and removal from office.” In the wanted post-style ad  Flynt listed a range of accusations against  [TGT]  including “massive conflicts-of-interest” and “gross nepotism and appointment of unqualified persons to high office.”",Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,,,,,,,,,
4836,This photo of Trump 's notes captures his empathy deficit better than anything,Trump,"President Trump  held a worthwhile listening session Wednesday featuring a range of views on how to combat gun violence in schools.

Yep  right there at No. 5 is a talking point about telling those present that  he  was actually listening to them. After what appear to be four questions  he  planned to ask those assembled  No. 5 is an apparent reminder for  Trump  to tell people  “I hear you.”
Even No. 1 is basically a reminder that  Trump  should empathize. “What would you most want me to know about your experience?” the card reads. So two-fifths of this card is dedicated to making sure the president of the United States assured those assembled that he was interested in what they had to say and their vantage points.
That's at once pretty striking for a president and not at all striking for  Trump . Through tragedy after tragedy  empathy has been the quality clearly missing from  Trump 's reactions. He has focused on first-responders rather than victims. He has joked around when he probably should have been somber. He has attacked a political leader who wasn't appreciative enough. Through it all  it's been clear that expressing that he feels others' pain just isn't his strength.","[TGT]held a worthwhile listening session Wednesday featuring a range of views on how to combat gun violence in schools.

At least one governor  Florida's Rick Scott  a Republican  asked for and received a waiver from  the administration .
""The President is endangering the health of nearly all coastal waters in our country  including our 400 miles of coastline in Rhode Island  so that rich oil companies can get richer.

We've taken action over the past few years to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative energy sources. We are home to the nation's first offshore windfarm.

""I am opposed to offshore drilling of South Carolina's shore. I am opposed to seismic testing off of South Carolina shore ""  he  said. ""We cannot take a chance with those resources  those industry and that economy. It is just too important. This is a matter of serious importance to us in South Carolina.""

4840,Trump's Infrastructure Plan Is Bigly Biased Against Cities,Trump,"President Trump's infrastructure plan  released Monday   is more of a defiance of fiscal logic than  it  is a rational outline. One obvious shortcoming is that  the plan  doesn't offer states and cities federal money as much as invite them to spend their own  which  of course  they could already do.
Perhaps the biggest drawback  though  is that  the plan  pits urban and rural areas against each other when it comes to the small amount of money it does offer. All of America needs investment  but the plan's blatant prejudice against cities would only widen the nation's political and cultural animosities.
 Trump  has disappointed in many ways  but this failure is an acute letdown. In the mid-1980s   Trump  scored one of  his  early p.r. coups with a modest New York City infrastructure triumph  finishing a Central Park skating rink after the city had failed. In 2016   he  ran heavily on the issue – and implied that  he 'd apply  his  supposed building expertise to  his  hometown. “We have the old Long Island Rail Road ”  he  said at one fundraiser  “like we're a third-world country. They have trains that go 250 mph  we have old stuff ”  he  continued  referring to China. “That's not going to happen anymore with  me .”
Yet the proposal  Trump  announced does nothing to advance real high-speed rail in dense corridors where it could work well. London is about to launch a train service to Amsterdam  covering 222 miles in three hours. Here  it still takes nearly four hours to get from New York to Boston  about the same distance.
Real high-speed rail is a multi-billion-dollar  long-term investment. Yet  Trump 's infrastructure proposal offers just $200 billion over a decade to all infrastructure. That's just 20 percent more than what the nation is already spending under an Obama-era law  and it is supposed to cover roads  highways  passenger rail  ports  airports  drinking water  flood control  and wastewater  and “transformative” projects  across 50 states as well as U.S. territories.
Never mind world-class rail  then.  Trump 's infrastructure proposal makes it more difficult to build an element needed just to keep existing rail service: a new tunnel under the Hudson River between Manhattan and New Jersey  so that the century-old one  which serves both Amtrak and Jersey commuters  can be closed and rehabbed. Whereas  the Obama administration  had offered to split the $14 billion or so cost with New York and New Jersey   the Trump administration  dismisses  it  as a “local” project.
And the infrastructure proposal says exactly how much  the administration  cares about such “local” projects. Of the $100 billion the proposal proffers to traditional infrastructure   it  caps the contribution to any one state at $10 billion. That means a state like New York might receive $5 billion for its portion the Hudson tunnel. But after that  it would have only $5 billion for other projects – when the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority alone was expecting $7.6 billion from federal sources for projects ranging from Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway to modernizing its signal systems.
Under the new “rural infrastructure program ” the definition of infrastructure is broader than the overall definition. It includes high-speed internet and government-owned electrical infrastructure  whereas elsewhere in the plan  Trump wants to sell such infrastructure to the private sector.
 The Trump infrastructure plan  is unfair  and economically unwise  beyond money.  The proposal  would also cede far more control to state politicians for rural projects than for urban or suburban ones.  The rural program  would provide 80 percent of  its  $50 billion  or $40 billion  to governors  who would “have discretion to choose individual investments to respond to the unique rural needs of their states ”  the proposal  says.
That's a stark contrast with the larger $100 billion program for everyone else. For  the bigger program   the federal government  not governors  will decide which projects to fund under a complex  likely manipulable formula involving predictions about matters such as “the incorporation of new and evolving technologies” – sometimes a good thing and sometimes not in the real world – and “ economic and social returns on investment.” Yet officials in urban areas often govern more people than entire states. The mayor of New York City has 8.5 million constituents  more than each of all but 11 states.","[TGT]'s infrastructure plan  released Monday   is more of a defiance of fiscal logic than  [TGT]  is a rational outline.

 The Trump dossier  is one of the strangest documents to surface during a presidential election. At 35 pages   it  was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and contains  allegations suggesting that the Trump campaign had close coordination with the Kremlin .  The document  also includes salacious claims about  President Trump himself .
Many of  the allegations  were already known to reporters before BuzzFeed published the dossier in January  saying “Americans can make up their own minds” about  Trump   then the president-elect. Officials said some of the information in the dossier has been corroborated  but other parts — including the most salacious claims about  Trump’s  behavior — remain unverified.
On Tuesday  The Washington Post reported that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee helped fund the research that led to the dossier  intensifying the political fights that surround the ongoing special counsel probe into possible connections between Russia and  Trump  associates.
In 2016  Mother Jones first reported that Democratic sources funded research efforts for the dossier. But on Tuesday  The Post went a step further  reporting that it was the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. A lawyer working on behalf of the campaign and the committee retained a Washington firm named Fusion GPS to do the research  which originally began during the Republican presidential primaries. The firm’s efforts were first supported by a Republican donor who had tasked the firm to look into Trump’s background. That individual’s identity remains unknown.
2. What was  Trump ’s reaction?

“Of course  he  said it ” Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled  “Yes  Donald Trump  You Said That”.
“President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history ” Bush said.
In the 2005 recording  which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post  Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent.
 Trump  on a hot mic   tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how “you can do anything” to women “when you’re a star.” He said he was able to “grab them by the pussy.”
After the recording’s release   Trump   then a presidential candidate  issued an apology and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter.
More recently   Trump  has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually  his   according to the New York Times.
Bush  who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release  confirms the voice is undoubtedly  Trump’s   but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”.
His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.","Former NBC host Billy Bush has lashed out at [TGT]for trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape  which captured  [TGT]  boasting about sexually assaulting women.

4846,NYT: Trump Wanted To Fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller Last June,Trump,"On Wednesday   President Trump  said  he  was looking forward to sitting down with Special Counsel Robert Mueller  who is heading up the DOJ’s probe into whether  his  campaign colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election. Yet  does Mueller know that  Trump  reportedly wanted  him  gone last June? The New York Times is reporting that  Trump  wanted to remove Mueller last June  but backed off when the White House counsel threatened resignation. Controversy erupted from the outset of this probe  as Mueller seemed to have assembled a team of die-hard Democrats  though the publication added that since the White House hired Ty Cobb  the lawyer that manages the relationship between 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and the Mueller probe  the criticism towards the investigation has been reduced significantly. Another idea that was reportedly tossed around was firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and putting Rachel Brand  the third highest-ranking DOJ official  in his place to oversee the Mueller.
Mr. McGahn disagreed with the president’s case and told senior White House officials that firing Mr. Mueller would have a catastrophic effect on  Mr. Trump’s  presidency. Mr. McGahn also told White House officials that  Mr. Trump  would not follow through on the dismissal on  his  own.  The president  then backed off.
Another option that  Mr. Trump  considered in discussions with  his  advisers was dismissing the deputy attorney general  Rod J. Rosenstein  and elevating the department’s No. 3  official  Rachel Brand  to oversee Mr. Mueller . Mr. Rosenstein has overseen the investigation since March  when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself.
 Mr. Trump  has significantly ratcheted back  his  criticisms of Mr. Mueller since he hired Mr. Cobb in July.  A veteran of several high-profile Washington controversies  Mr. Cobb  has known Mr. Mueller for decades  dating to their early careers in the Justice Department.
 He  advised  Mr. Trump  that  he  had nothing to gain from combat with Mr. Mueller  a highly respected former prosecutor and F.B.I. director who has subpoena power as special counsel. Since Mr. Cobb’s arrival  the White House has operated on the premise that the quickest way to clear the cloud of suspicion was to cooperate with Mr. Mueller  not to fight him.","On Wednesday   [TGT]said  [TGT]  was looking forward to sitting down with Special Counsel Robert Mueller  who is heading up the DOJ’s probe into whether  [TGT]  campaign colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election.

4847,Trump asked intelligence chiefs to push back against FBI collusion probe after Comey revealed its existence,Trump,"President Trump asked two of the nation’s top intelligence officials in March to help  him  push back against an FBI investigation into possible coordination between  his  campaign and the Russian government  according to current and former officials.
 Trump  made separate appeals to the director of national intelligence  Daniel Coats  and to Adm. Michael S. Rogers  the director of the National Security Agency  urging them to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election.
 Trump  sought the assistance of Coats and Rogers after FBI Director James B. Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating “the nature of any links between individuals associated with the  Trump  campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.”
 Trump’s  conversation with Rogers was documented contemporaneously in an internal memo written by a senior NSA official  according to the officials. It is unclear if a similar memo was prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to document  Trump ’s conversation with Coats. Officials said such memos could be made available to both the special counsel now overseeing the Russia investigation and congressional investigators  who might explore whether  Trump  sought to impede the FBI’s work.
White House officials say Comey’s testimony about the scope of the FBI investigation upset  Trump   who has dismissed the FBI and congressional investigations as a “witch hunt.” The president has repeatedly said there was no collusion.
Current and former senior intelligence officials viewed  Trump’s  requests as an attempt by the president to tarnish the credibility of the agency leading the Russia investigation.
A senior intelligence official said  Trump’s  goal was to “muddy the waters” about the scope of the FBI probe at a time when Democrats were ramping up their calls for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel  a step announced last week.
In addition to the requests to Coats and Rogers  senior White House officials sounded out top intelligence officials about the possibility of intervening directly with Comey to encourage the FBI to drop its probe of Michael Flynn  Trump’s former national security adviser  according to people familiar with the matter. The officials said the White House appeared uncertain about its power to influence the FBI.
The new revelations add to a growing body of evidence that  Trump  sought to co-opt and then undermine Comey before he fired him May 9. According to notes kept by  Comey  Trump  first asked for  his  loyalty at a dinner in January and then  at a meeting the next month  asked  him  to drop the probe into Flynn.  Trump  disputes those accounts.
Current and former officials said that  Trump  either lacks an understanding of the FBI’s role as an independent law enforcement agency or does not care about maintaining such boundaries.
 Trump’s  effort to use the director of national intelligence and the NSA director to dispute Comey’s statement and to say there was no evidence of collusion echoes President Richard Nixon’s “unsuccessful efforts to use the CIA to shut down the FBI’s investigation of the Watergate break-in on national security grounds ” said Jeffrey H. Smith  a former general counsel at the CIA. Smith called  Trump ’s actions “an appalling abuse of power.”
 Trump  made  his  appeal to Coats days after Comey’s testimony  according to officials.
That same week   Trump  telephoned Rogers to make a similar appeal.
In  his  call with  Rogers  Trump  urged the NSA director to speak out publicly if there was no evidence of collusion  according to officials briefed on the exchange.
While relations between  Trump  and Comey were strained by the Russia probe  ties between the president and the other intelligence chiefs  including Rogers  Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo  appear to be less contentious  according to officials.
Rogers met with  Trump  in New York shortly after the election  and  Trump ’s advisers at the time held him out as the leading candidate to be the next director of national intelligence.","[TGT] asked two of the nation’s top intelligence officials in March to help  [TGT]  push back against an FBI investigation into possible coordination between  [TGT]  campaign and the Russian government  according to current and former officials.

4848,Dismayed by Trump  Head of Drug Enforcement Administration to Leave,Trump,"WASHINGTON —  The acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration  will resign at the end of the week  according to law enforcement officials  who said  he  had become convinced that  President Trump  had little respect for the law.

4849,Trump on Iran's 'Multiple Violations',Trump,"In refusing to certify the Iran nuclear deal   President Donald Trump  said Iran “has committed multiple violations of the agreement.” But that’s not the finding of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
 Trump himself  has certified to Congress on two occasions that Iran has complied with the nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  or JCPOA.  The president  must issue a certification every 90 days.
On Oct. 13   Trump  announced that  he  would not once again certify Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA.  His  decision “gives Congress the option to introduce legislation reimposing U.S. sanctions waived or suspended under the JCPOA on an expedited schedule ” the Arms Control Association says.
 Trump  said Iran committed “multiple violations” of the JCPOA  which was negotiated by the U.S.  China  France  Germany  Russia and the United Kingdom  as well as representatives of the European Union and Iran.
Trump  Oct. 13: Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. For example  on two separate occasions  they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water. Until recently  the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges. The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites  even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of Iran’s clandestine nuclear weapons program.
Let’s take a look at each of the three issues Trump raised  beginning with the limits on heavy water.
On two occasions  Iran has slightly exceeded the limits. The first time was in February 2016  a month after the agreement was implemented  and again in November. So  Trump  is right  although  he  was aware of these violations when  he  agreed twice before to certify Iran’s compliance.
As for Trump’s concern about advanced centrifuges  David Albright  an IAEA weapons inspector in Iraq during the 1990s and founder of the Institute for Science and International Security  said that issue has been resolved.
Trump’s reference to inspections at military sites refers to Section T of the JCPOA that covers the development of dual-use equipment that has civilian and military applications  according to Albright  an adviser to the Trump administration. Albright said the IAEA needs access to military sites in order to verify Iran’s compliance with Section T of the agreement.
“This is the most egregious of Trump’s claims ” Davenport  of the Arms Control Association  told us. “The IAEA clearly stated that Iran has granted inspectors all of the access the agency has requested. If Iran had blocked access  the P5+1  including the United States  would not have been able to say that Iran is complying with the accord.”
In a statement issued in response to Trump’s speech  IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said that “the IAEA has had access to all locations it needed to visit.”
We take no position on Trump’s desire to renegotiate aspects of the Iran deal that he does not like. The issue  though  is whether Iran has complied with the existing agreement  and even those within his own administration have said that Iran is in compliance.
Correction  Oct. 14: We originally wrote that  Trump  was referring to the Parchin military site when  he  criticized Iran for not allowing IAEA inspections of military sites. Albright  an adviser to the president  told us that  Trump  was referring to inspections at all military sites  not just Parchin  to ensure that Iran is in compliance with Section T of the JCPOA. That section covers the development of dual-use equipment that can be used for civilian and military purposes.

4850,Laura Ingraham: I Was Asked During GOP Convention to Primary Ted Cruz in 2018,Trump,"“People were so torched by Cruz’s failure to endorse Trump that talk of primarying him ignited almost the moment he walked off the stage ” Ingraham wrote in her new book  Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump. “In fact  a tanned  good-old-boy type in his late 40s approached me and asked me if I’d consider moving to Texas to run against him.”
Ingraham witnessed the moment Cruz declined to endorse  President Trump  in  his  speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland  Ohio. Moments before  he  took the stage  Ingraham said she told Cruz to “endorse” Trump in his speech.
 Instead of endorsing Trump  Cruz  told Americans to “vote your conscience” in  his  convention speech  causing the crowd to react with jeers and boos.
“The arena reverberated with boos and chants of ‘Endorse Trump!'” Ingraham wrote. “I have never heard a crowd jeer even after a speaker is finished speaking.”
The fallout from  his  speech did not end there  as  he  also faced backlash from some high-profile GOP donors.
In her book  Ingraham recounted how GOP-mega donor Sheldon Adelson told security not to let Cruz into  his  suite following the speech.
Cruz eventually endorsed  Trump  on September 23  four months after he dropped out of the presidential race and resumed his work in the U.S. Senate.
Ingraham also revealed several other behind-the-scenes insights about the 2016 Republican presidential primary and the general election that propelled  Trump  to victory  such as the real reason  Trump  did not choose New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as his vice presidential pick.
She also revealed that GOP senators “laughed out loud” at  Trump ’s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border in a private meeting.","“People were so torched by Cruz’s failure to endorse Trump that talk of primarying him ignited almost the moment he walked off the stage ” Ingraham wrote in her new book  Billionaire at the Barricades: [TGT]. “In fact  a tanned  good-old-boy type in [TGT] late 40s approached me and asked me if I’d consider moving to Texas to run against him.”

4851,In Missouri speech  Trump touts benefits of tax cuts for 'the people that like me best',Trump,"With a critical Senate vote looming  President Donald Trump on Wednesday pitched the Republican tax plan as a boon to  his  working-class supporters  even as independent analyses have indicated that the wealthy and corporations would be the biggest beneficiaries.
""Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mail rooms and the machine shops of America  the plumbers  the carpenters  the cops  the teachers  the truck drivers . ... the people that like me best ""  Trump  said in remarks to an enthusiastic  invitation-only crowd of about 1 000 at a convention center in a state that he carried comfortably in last year's election.
""Really  the people that like me best are those people  the workers ""  Trump  said. ""They're the people I understand the best. ... They came out to vote for me. They came out to vote for us.""
 Trump  appeared upbeat as  he  addressed the crowd from a stage lined with Christmas trees  urging the Senate to pass the bill in coming days.
""The big day will be either tomorrow or the next day ""  Trump  said. ""I would say  'Do it now.' ""
If the bill passes  the Senate will have to work out differences with the House  which has passed its own version of a tax-cut bill.  Trump  referred to the process as ""a mixer"" and said  he  hopes to have compromise legislation on  his  desk by Christmas.
""Together we will give the American people a big  beautiful Christmas present ""  Trump  told the crowd. ""You're going to have something I predict is going to be really  really special.""
Several recent polls show that more Americans oppose than support the  Trump  and GOP tax plans. A Quinnipiac poll this month found about twice as many disapproving as approving (52 percent vs. 25 percent)  with nearly a quarter offering no opinion.
Polls have also found a widespread perception that the  Trump  tax plan is geared toward the wealthy. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll this month  60 percent said his tax proposal favors the rich  while 13 percent thought it favors the middle class  2 percent said it favors the poor  and 17 percent said it treats all equally.
During his remarks here in the St. Louis area   Trump  suggested that the GOP efforts were widely popular.
"" We  have tremendous support for this plan  tremendous ""  he  said.
 Trump  also said that  he  would not fare well under the plan - a contention that independent analyses have disputed - and that some of  his  wealthy friends have complained to  him  about it.
 Trump  acknowledged that critics are saying that the legislation would benefit the wealthy.
""If it is  my friends don't know about it ""  he  said.
 Trump  said the tax plan would be good for corporations  which would see a drop in the tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.  Trump  and other Republicans have argued that companies would use the windfall to create more jobs and raise wages  benefiting the middle and lower classes. Many economists have questioned that premise  however.
 Trump 's trip to the ""Show Me State"" was  his  second since becoming president. In August   he  launched a concerted public effort to pass tax legislation during an event in Springfield  Missouri.","With a critical Senate vote looming  [TGT] on Wednesday pitched the Republican tax plan as a boon to  [TGT]  working-class supporters  even as independent analyses have indicated that the wealthy and corporations would be the biggest beneficiaries.
""Our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mail rooms and the machine shops of America  the plumbers  the carpenters  the cops  the teachers  the truck drivers . ... the people that like me best ""  Trump  said in remarks to an enthusiastic  invitation-only crowd of about 1 000 at a convention center in a state that he carried comfortably in last year's election.
""Really  the people that like me best are those people  the workers [TGT]said. ""They're the people I understand the best. ... They came out to vote for me. They came out to vote for us.[TGT]appeared upbeat as  [TGT]  addressed the crowd from a stage lined with Christmas trees  urging the Senate to pass the bill in coming days.
""The big day will be either tomorrow or the next day [TGT]said. ""I would say  'Do it now.' ""
If the bill passes  the Senate will have to work out differences with the House  which has passed its own version of a tax-cut bill.  [TGT]referred to the process as ""a mixer"" and said  [TGT]  hopes to have compromise legislation on  [TGT]  desk by Christmas.
""Together we will give the American people a big  beautiful Christmas present [TGT]told the crowd. ""You're going to have something I predict is going to be really  really special.""
Several recent polls show that more Americans oppose than support the  [TGT]and GOP tax plans. A Quinnipiac poll this month found about twice as many disapproving as approving (52 percent vs. 25 percent)  with nearly a quarter offering no opinion.
Polls have also found a widespread perception that [TGT] is geared toward the wealthy. In a Washington Post-ABC News poll this month  60 percent said his tax proposal favors the rich  while 13 percent thought it favors the middle class  2 percent said it favors the poor  and 17 percent said it treats all equally.
During his remarks here in the St. Louis area   [TGT]suggested that the GOP efforts were widely popular.
"" We  have tremendous support for [TGT]tremendous ""  he  said.
 [TGT]also said that  [TGT]  would not fare well under the plan - a contention that independent analyses have disputed - and that some of  [TGT]  wealthy friends have complained to  [TGT]  about it.
 [TGT]acknowledged that critics are saying that the legislation would benefit the wealthy.

4852,Congress Faces A New Deadline On The Budget This Week : NPR,Trump,"MARTIN: All right. So Congress hasn't been talking about the budget or immigration. They have been talking about memos - one in particular. Last week ended with the release of this partisan memo written by House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes.  President Trump  says that the memo vindicates  him  on the Russia investigation.  He  - clearly  the president believes that this is going to have some kind of effect.
DETROW: Yeah. It was interesting. You had a lot of Republicans  House Speaker Paul Ryan and others  saying this memo was not about taking down the Mueller investigation. It was not about discrediting the FBI. Then  President Trump  over the weekend comes out and says that it's exactly that - that this proves the Russia investigation is a hoax. So many Republicans actually pushed back on that over the weekend after  President Trump  said that  among them South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy speaking to CBS.
TREY GOWDY: The dossier has nothing to do with a meeting at Trump Tower. The dossier has nothing to do with an email sent by Cambridge Analytica. The dossier really has nothing to do with George Papadopoulos' meeting in Great Britain. It also doesn't have anything to do with obstruction of justice. So there's going to be a Russia probe even without a dossier.
DETROW: Exactly. The argument was that the FBI took this document with partisan beginnings and used it to get wiretaps approved. And Gowdy was laying out several other factors that the FBI was allegedly looking at. But  you know  this memo certainly has muddied the water and led to a lot of Republicans bashing the FBI  bashing the Justice Department. And President Trump seems confident that even if this doesn't undermine the investigation itself  it may undermine public confidence in whatever the investigation concludes.
DETROW: Unclear. The House Intelligence Committee meets this afternoon and may vote on that. Even if they approve it   President Trump  would have to give the final OK. And given the way that  he  views the Republican memo as vindicating  him   hard to see  him  OK'ing...","MARTIN: All right. So Congress hasn't been talking about the budget or immigration.

4853,Democrats say President Trump 's tweets about Sen. Gillibrand are sexist crude,Trump,"Plowing into the sexual harassment debate in a big way   President Donald Trump  laced into Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday  tweeting that the New York Democrat would come to his office ""begging"" for campaign contributions and ""do anything"" to get them. Democrats accused the president of making unsavory insinuations.
Gillibrand  D-N.Y.  who had called for  Trump 's resignation a day earlier because of allegations of sexual misconduct  called  Trump 's attack a ""sexist smear attempting to silence my voice.""

Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!""
A day earlier  Gillibrand said  Trump  should resign because there were credible accusations against  him . And barring that  she said  ""Congress should investigate the multiple sexual harassment and assault allegations against  him .""
 Trump 's tweet Tuesday morning inflamed Democrats who said  the president  was again debasing a woman.  Trump  did not respond to similar resignation calls from Sen. Bernie Sanders  an independent from Vermont  and Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.
Rep. John Yarmuth  D-Ky.  said  Trump  had ""proven to be a poison for the presidency  a cancer on the country  and a truly disgraceful human being.""

Solis Doyle tweeted: ""'And would do anything for them'. What does that mean  @realDonaldTrump?! You  a man  accused by more than a dozen credible women of assault and harassment  has the audacity make this vile  disgusting implication. SHAME!""
More than a dozen women came forward during last year's campaign  many in the wake of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which  Trump  is heard bragging about committing sexual assault  to say that the celebrity businessman had harassed them.
With each day seeming to bring new headlines that force men from positions of power  four of  Trump 's accusers re-upped their claims Monday  believing the national movement on sexual harassment should force change at the White House too.
 Trump  has denied the claims. In a heated exchange with reporters in the White House briefing room on Monday  press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders steadfastly dismissed accusations against the Republican president and suggested the issue had been litigated in  Trump 's favor on Election Day.
 Trump  donated $4 800 to Gillibrand's Senate campaign in 2010  according to federal campaign finance records. Before launching  his  presidential campaign   Trump  frequently bestowed donations on politicians of both parties.

4856,Jimmy Carter: Media tougher on Trump than any other president in memory,Trump,"Jimmy Carter  the liberal 93-year-old former president  surprisingly sided with  President Trump  when  he  told The New York Times that the media have been too hostile on the current commander-in-chief.
“I think the media have been harder on  Trump  than any other president certainly that I’ve known about ” Carter told The New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.  The 39th president  served one term from 1977 to 1981.
Carter added that he thought the media “feel free to claim that  Trump  is mentally deranged and everything else without hesitation.”
 The former president  also pushed back on accusations of Russian collusion in the 2016 presidential election  saying: “I don’t think there’s any evidence that what the Russians did changed enough votes  or any votes.”  He  said  his  wife  Rosalynn  disagreed with  him   before he added  “We voted for [Bernie] Sanders” in the primary.
Carter also doesn’t believe the current president’s “America First” strategy is out of step with the larger world  spoiling international relations. “Well   he  might be escalating it but I think that precedes  Trump  ”  he  told the Times. “The United States has been the dominant character in the whole world and now we’re not anymore. And we’re not going to be. Russia’s coming back and India and China are coming forward.”
In September  Carter expressed optimism that  Trump  might break a legislative logjam with  his  six-month deadline for Congress to address the immigration status of 800 000-plus U.S. residents who were brought to the country illegally as children.
Carter told Emory University students that the “pressures and the publicity that  Trump  has brought to the immigration issue” could even yield comprehensive immigration law changes that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama could not muster.
“I don’t see that as a hopeless cause ” Carter said. He added that  Trump ’s critics  including  himself   “have to give  him  credit when  he  does some things that are not as bad” as they are depicted.","Jimmy Carter  the liberal 93-year-old former president  surprisingly sided with [TGT]when  he  told The New York Times that the media have been too hostile on the current commander-in-chief.

4857,Trump is so obsessed with winning that he might make America lose,Trump,"It is perhaps  his  most essential quality:  President Trump  is determined to triumph — and to see America triumph alongside  him . “I win against China. You can win against China if you’re smart ”  he  said at a campaign event in July 2015. “Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!”  he  tweeted during the campaign. “China  Japan  Mexico  Brazil  these countries are all taking our jobs  like we’re a bunch of babies. That will stop ”  he  once promised.
In Trump’s view of the world  there is a finite amount of everything — money  security  jobs  victories — and nothing can be shared.  He  previewed this week’s imposition of steel tariffs when  he  said during the campaign that foreign smelters are “killing our steelworkers and steel companies.”  He  promised during  his  State of the Union address to protect “our” citizens over the undocumented “dreamers.” In other words  the United States  and all of its inhabitants  are in a zero-sum competition over everything  all the time. And you’re either victorious or defeated. It’s a universe where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must  as Thucydides said.
The problem is that the triumphs that  Trump  craves — strength  safety  prosperity — cannot be achieved alone. They require friends and allies  and they require the president to see those people as partners  not competitors. But  Trump  doesn’t know how to do that  which makes everyone suspicious; other governments don’t like to be punching bags  the only role  he  appears to envision for them. Mutual distrust imperils the collaboration the United States needs to succeed. Which is to say   Trump’s  determination to win could easily position the country to lose.
As the first person elected U.S. president without having served in government or the military  perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect  Trump  to have a carefully considered view of America’s role in the world. But a year into his presidency  it’s clear that his core beliefs come from the business world  where the focus is on the bottom line. In real estate  relationships often take the form of one-off transactions: You can cheat people you’ll never do business with again. A dollar off the price is a dollar you keep  and  Trump  has no doubt made a lot of dollars that way.
President Trump on March 1 announced tariffs on steel and aluminum. “Without steel and aluminum  your country is not the same ”  Trump  said. (The Washington Post)
As president   he  seems to have a similar view — that U.S. interests rise only at the expense of others. Winners have trade surpluses  and losers have trade deficits. Jobs move from losing countries to winning countries. The United States is the biggest economy with the biggest military  and therefore the United States has leverage to get the best deals. If we don’t emerge from negotiation with a clear advantage  that’s because our negotiator was a soft-headed  do-gooder globalist who didn’t put America first. NAFTA  for instance  was Bill Clinton’s agreement (even though it began under George H.W. Bush). And “Iran was on its last legs . . . until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal ”  Trump  tweeted a year ago. The world is a tough place filled with tough people who watch you every second for a chance to take advantage   he  believes — and the American president is elected to care about Pittsburgh  not Paris.
Washington has the most leverage when it deals with countries one on one  which is why   he  says  “we need bilateral trade deals ” not “another international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.” To abide by the same rules as less-powerful countries would be to sublimate American interests to those of lesser nations.
The world’s wealth is like a pie  and it’s the president’s responsibility to ensure that the strongest country gets the biggest piece.  Trump  seeks to begin negotiations with a threat that forces the other side to defend  its  smaller piece.  He  pledges to tear up NAFTA  rip up the Iran nuclear deal and revisit America’s relationship with NATO — unless  he  gets concessions. And  he  gains advantage not by telling the truth  but by saying things  he  believes will boost  his  bargaining power and sell  his  vision: China has been allowed to “rape our country.” Mexico is deliberately exporting criminals into the United States  but the wall will bring that to a stop. U.S. allies are laughing at American taxpayers.
Trump casts alliances as partnerships that burden strong nations with free-riding  freeloading “allies ” such as NATO members that don’t spend enough on defense  and the governments of Japan and South Korea  which expect the United States to protect them from China. This is where critics who say he’s an isolationist go awry. The man who launched missiles at Syria to punish its violations of a chemical weapons treaty is not opposed to intervention in other countries. He’s just an alliance-hating unilateralist.
The zero-sum cosmology touches everything. Obamacare supposedly sticks us with the bill for people who should pay for their own insurance — or a find a job that provides it.  Trump  even told The Washington Post’s Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher  authors of the biography “ Trump  Revealed ” that  he  doesn’t exercise  because “the human body was like a battery  with a finite amount of energy  which exercise only depleted.”
There are kernels of truth that undergird Trump’s view. It’s a disgrace that the United States is one of just five of NATO’s 29 members to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense  as required by the alliance’s rules. “America First” is a sensible response to his predecessors  who sometimes behaved as if America was becoming stronger in the world; it is not  and our policy should reflect that. China is more a strategic competitor than a real partner linked by shared values. Trade does produce winners and losers  as falling barriers allow companies to move jobs to places where wages are lower. A study published by the Pew Research Center in December 2015 found that “after more than four decades of serving as the nation’s economic majority  the American middle class is now matched in number by those in the economic tiers above and below it.” That’s a real problem  and  Trump  is right to point it out.
But  his  belief that winners win and losers lose has led  him  toward many unforced errors.  He  could have demanded that NATO members pay more without signaling that  he  might abandon the mutual-defense agreement that undergirds a treaty to contain Russia. “America First” makes sense only if Americans are willing to lead by example  showing the world that democracy is best by moving beyond petty partisanship to build the compromises on which progress depends. Other nations might be more wowed by “America First” if it invested more money in education  rebuilt infrastructure and focused exports on technology  energy and food. People elsewhere must believe that America is too important to fail.
Relations among nations are not like real estate deals. The president has to negotiate with the same people again the next month  and they’ll remember how they’ve been treated. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu never forgave President Barack Obama for openly criticizing his approach to settlement-building; imagine how every other leader feels about being constantly humiliated by  Trump . Other countries form judgments about whether American promises are credible and whether they can trust the president.  Trump  says  he ’s willing to talk with North Korea about its nuclear program  but surely Kim Jong Un is watching as  Trump  threatens to shred the Iran nuclear agreement. Why not just deal with other countries? There are many options.
The biggest is China. The Chinese are writing checks. They’re investing in other nations and making deals that serve China’s interests. Its economy is just two-thirds the size of ours  but its government is working to create economic links — and political dependence — across the world  even as  Trump  says we need to focus our attention domestically. The Belt and Road Initiative  China’s plan to blaze new commercial trails and cement new political ties via infrastructure investment in dozens of countries  is seven times larger than the Marshall Plan when adjusted for inflation. More than 120 nations already trade more with China than with the United States. And they’re not just developing countries. China is investing in smaller European Union members like Hungary and Greece to alter official E.U. attitudes toward Beijing. That’s why the Trans-Pacific Partnership  which  Trump  quashed  was more than just a trade deal. By joining   Trump  could have expanded U.S. ties with many of China’s neighbors  governments that fear overreliance on China’s goodwill for future growth.
 Trump’s  win-or-lose philosophy is most confused when it comes to immigration. Foreigners who want to become Americans are not charity cases. They participate in the labor force at higher rates (73.4 percent  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics) than native-born Americans. A higher percentage of immigrants than native-born Americans own small businesses . That’s reality  not soft-headed sentiment  and  Trump ’s tendency to hire foreign guest workers over Americans at his own properties suggests that he understands something about how hard they work.
Immigrants boost growth and strengthen the social safety net. They bring the drive and energy  Trump  often cites when talking about  himself ; they’ve already taken bold action and faced down risks to reimagine their futures. They pay their way. The undocumented contribute $13 billion to the nation’s retirement fund each year and get just $1 billion in return. Immigrants are also innovative: “More than three out of every four patents at the top 10 patent-producing US universities (76%) had at least one foreign-born inventor ” according to a 2012 study.","It is perhaps  his  most essential quality:  [TGT]is determined to triumph — and to see America triumph alongside  [TGT] . “I win against China. You can win against China if you’re smart ”  [TGT]  said at a campaign event in July 2015. “Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!”  [TGT]  tweeted during the campaign. “China  Japan  Mexico  Brazil  these countries are all taking our jobs  like we’re a bunch of babies. That will stop ”  he  once promised.
In Trump’s view of the world  there is a finite amount of everything — money  security  jobs  victories — and nothing can be shared.  He  previewed this week’s imposition of steel tariffs when  he  said during the campaign that foreign smelters are “killing our steelworkers and steel companies.”  He  promised during  his  State of the Union address to protect “our” citizens over the undocumented “dreamers.” In other words  the United States  and all of its inhabitants  are in a zero-sum competition over everything  all the time. And you’re either victorious or defeated. It’s a universe where the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must  as Thucydides said.
The problem is that the triumphs that  Trump  craves — strength  safety  prosperity — cannot be achieved alone. They require friends and allies  and they require the president to see those people as partners  not competitors. But [TGT]doesn’t know how to do that  which makes everyone suspicious; other governments don’t like to be punching bags  the only role  [TGT]  appears to envision for them. Mutual distrust imperils the collaboration the United States needs to succeed. Which is to say   Trump’s  determination to win could easily position the country to lose.
As the first person elected U.S. president without having served in government or the military  perhaps it’s unrealistic to expect  [TGT]  to have a carefully considered view of America’s role in the world. But a year into his presidency  it’s clear that his core beliefs come from the business world  where the focus is on the bottom line. In real estate  relationships often take the form of one-off transactions: You can cheat people you’ll never do business with again. A dollar off the price is a dollar you keep  and  [TGT]has no doubt made a lot of dollars that way.
[TGT] on March 1 announced tariffs on steel and aluminum. “Without steel and aluminum  your country is not the same ”  [TGT]said. (The Washington Post)
As president   he  seems to have a similar view — that U.S. interests rise only at the expense of others. Winners have trade surpluses  and losers have trade deficits. Jobs move from losing countries to winning countries. The United States is the biggest economy with the biggest military  and therefore the United States has leverage to get the best deals. If we don’t emerge from negotiation with a clear advantage  that’s because our negotiator was a soft-headed  do-gooder globalist who didn’t put America first. NAFTA  for instance  was Bill Clinton’s agreement (even though it began under George H.W. Bush). And “Iran was on its last legs . . . until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal ”  [TGT]tweeted a year ago. The world is a tough place filled with tough people who watch you every second for a chance to take advantage   [TGT]  believes — and the American president is elected to care about Pittsburgh  not Paris.
Washington has the most leverage when it deals with countries one on one  which is why   [TGT]  says  “we need bilateral trade deals ” not “another international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.” To abide by the same rules as less-powerful countries would be to sublimate American interests to those of lesser nations.
The world’s wealth is like a pie  and it’s the president’s responsibility to ensure that the strongest country gets the biggest piece.  [TGT]seeks to begin negotiations with a threat that forces the other side to defend  [TGT]  smaller piece.  [TGT]  pledges to tear up NAFTA  rip up the Iran nuclear deal and revisit [TGT] relationship with NATO — unless  he  gets concessions. And  he  gains advantage not by telling the truth  but by saying things  he  believes will boost  his  bargaining power and sell  his  vision: China has been allowed to “rape our country.” Mexico is deliberately exporting criminals into the United States  but the wall will bring that to a stop. U.S. allies are laughing at American taxpayers.
[TGT] casts alliances as partnerships that burden strong nations with free-riding  freeloading “allies ” such as NATO members that don’t spend enough on defense  and the governments of Japan and South Korea  which expect the United States to protect them from China. This is where critics who say he’s an isolationist go awry. The man who launched missiles at Syria to punish its violations of a chemical weapons treaty is not opposed to intervention in other countries. He’s just an alliance-hating unilateralist.
The zero-sum cosmology touches everything. Obamacare supposedly sticks us with the bill for people who should pay for their own insurance — or a find a job that provides it.  [TGT]even told The Washington Post’s Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher  [TGT][TGT]  doesn’t exercise  because “the human body was like a battery  with a finite amount of energy  which exercise only depleted.”
There are kernels of truth that undergird Trump’s view. It’s a disgrace that the United States is one of just five of NATO’s 29 members to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense  as required by the alliance’s rules. “America First” is a sensible response to his predecessors  who sometimes behaved as if America was becoming stronger in the world; it is not  and our policy should reflect that. China is more a strategic competitor than a real partner linked by shared values. Trade does produce winners and losers  as falling barriers allow companies to move jobs to places where wages are lower. A study published by the Pew Research Center in December 2015 found that “after more than four decades of serving as the nation’s economic majority  the American middle class is now matched in number by those in the economic tiers above and below it.” That’s a real problem  and  [TGT]is right to point it out.
But  [TGT]  belief that winners win and losers lose has led  [TGT]  toward many unforced errors.  [TGT]  could have demanded that NATO members pay more without signaling that  [TGT]  might abandon the mutual-defense agreement that undergirds a treaty to contain Russia. “America First” makes sense only if Americans are willing to lead by example  showing the world that democracy is best by moving beyond petty partisanship to build the compromises on which progress depends. Other nations might be more wowed by “America First” if it invested more money in education  rebuilt infrastructure and focused exports on technology  energy and food. People elsewhere must believe that America is too important to fail.
Relations among nations are not like real estate deals. The president has to negotiate with the same people again the next month  and they’ll remember how they’ve been treated. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu never forgave President Barack Obama for openly criticizing his approach to settlement-building; imagine how every other leader feels about being constantly humiliated by [TGT] . Other countries form judgments about whether American promises are credible and whether they can trust the president.  [TGT]says  [TGT] ’s willing to talk with North Korea about its nuclear program  but surely Kim Jong Un is watching as  [TGT]threatens to shred the Iran nuclear agreement. Why not just deal with other countries? There are many options.
The biggest is China. The Chinese are writing checks. They’re investing in other nations and making deals that serve China’s interests. [TGT] economy is just two-thirds the size of ours  but [TGT] government is working to create economic links — and political dependence — across the world  even as  [TGT]says we need to focus our attention domestically. The Belt and Road Initiative  China’s plan to blaze new commercial trails and cement new political ties via infrastructure investment in dozens of countries  is seven times larger than the Marshall Plan when adjusted for inflation. More than 120 nations already trade more with China than with the United States. And they’re not just developing countries. China is investing in smaller European Union members like Hungary and Greece to alter official E.U. attitudes toward Beijing. That’s why the Trans-Pacific Partnership  which  [TGT]  quashed  was more than just a trade deal. By joining   [TGT]could have expanded U.S. ties with many of China’s neighbors  governments that fear overreliance on China’s goodwill for future growth.

4858,Rand Paul Calls for Investigation of Obama Officials Colluding Against Trump : 'Worse than Watergate!',Trump,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) on Thursday called for an investigation about “high ranking Obama government officials” who might have worked together to stop  the election of President Trump .

Time to investigate high ranking Obama government officials who might have colluded to prevent  the election of @realDonaldTrump ! This could be WORSE than Watergate! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) December 21  2017
Paul’s call adds a high-profile voice to the chorus of Republicans who are calling for a special counsel to investigate whether Obama officials tried to stop Trump’s election  in the face of mounting evidence.
So far  congressional investigators have found out that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for  the Trump dossier   through their law firm Perkins Coie. Clinton campaign and DNC officials have denied knowing about it. Perkins Coie initially denied funding  the dossier   before they were forced to admit  it  after the House intelligence committee subpoenaed for financial records.
 The dossier  was then given to the FBI in the summer  when  the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign  began  and when  it  applied for a surveillance warrant to spy on  Trump  campaign adviser Carter Page. Congressional investigators are finding out whether the dossier — an unconfirmed piece of anti-Trump opposition research — was used as evidence to launch  the investigation  and get a spy warrant.
Around that same time  senior FBI official Peter Strzok — who played a major role on the Clinton email investigation  watered down language that exonerated her from wrongdoing  and signed off on the FBI’s initial Russia probe — discussed in deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe’s office the possibility of Trump’s election. “I’m afraid we can’t take that risk ” he had texted another FBI official with whom he was having an extramarital affair. He was later assigned to Robert Mueller’s special counsel  but was removed in July over those and hundreds of other anti-Trump texts.
As Republicans in Congress have learned these revelations  Democrats have tried to bring attention to Robert Mueller’s special counsel  arguing that Republicans and  President Trump  are trying to shut it down  despite  him  recently saying  he  had no intention of doing so.
Recently  the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee  Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA)  argued that there is already proof in “plain sight” that  the Trump campaign  colluded  and the special counsel had to continue  in order to prove  it  beyond a reasonable doubt.","Sen.

4860,Pressure on FBI mounts after failure to pursue tip on Florida suspect,Trump,"Even before the startling disclosure that the FBI failed to investigate a warning that the suspect  Nikolas Cruz  could be plotting an attack  the bureau was facing unprecedented criticism from President Trump and other Republicans  who have accused it of partisan bias.

The legislation  which the GOP aims to muscle through Congress next week  would lower taxes on the richest Americans.

4863,Trump steps up rhetorical support for Iran protestors,Trump,"Washington (AFP) –  President Donald Trump  tried to ramp up pressure on Iran’s “brutal and corrupt” regime amid a sixth day of anti-government protests Tuesday  ignoring warnings that  his  intervention could backfire.
 Trump  demanded a snap UN Security Council meeting to debate unrest that has killed 21 people — mostly protestors — and fired off ever-harsher condemnations of the Islamic republic’s rulers.
“The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime ”  Trump  tweeted  setting the tone a fresh rhetorical blitz on America’s old enemy in Tehran.
 His  top diplomat at the United Nations  Ambassador Nikki Haley  used her public platform to recite protestors’ slogans and declared that “the people of Iran are crying out for freedom.”
 Trump  — flanked in the White House by a coterie of former generals who spent a career fighting Iranian proxies from Beirut to Baghdad — has taken a hard line against Iran since coming to office.
 He  has abandoned Obama-era diplomatic overtures and embraced allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia who are keen to confront Iran’s growing regional power.
Much of Trump’s response has focused on playing up perceived errors by the Obama administration  not least a deal that gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.
“All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their ‘pockets.’ The people have little food  big inflation and no human rights. The US is watching!”  Trump  tweeted.
Trump — who built  his  broader political fortunes around opposing America’s first black president — has left the fate of that deal with Congress while  he  continues to oppose it.
Obama’s muted support for 2009 protests in Iran has also appeared to play a role in the  Trump  administration’s’ more vocal response.
 He  has taken to Twitter multiple times since the protests erupted last week.
On Monday   he  said it was “time for change” in Iran and that the country’s people were “hungry” for freedom.
In response to Trump’s latest Twitter attack  Iranian officials have said online accounts in the United States  Britain and Saudi Arabia are fomenting protests  which Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed on the country’s “enemies.”

4864,The 'Missed Opportunity' Of Trump's Asia Trip : Parallels : NPR,Trump,"The 'Missed Opportunity' Of  Trump's Asia Trip
When  President Trump  returned this week from a 12-day  five-nation swing through Asia   he  gave  himself  high marks for the ""tremendous success of  this trip .""
But experts say that while  he  avoided major blunders during  his  stops in Japan  South Korea  Japan  Vietnam and the Philippines  the president missed more than one opportunity to offer  his  administration's strategic vision for the region — the world's largest  most populous and fastest growing.
""It was all fluff "" says David Shambaugh  a professor of political science and international affairs at the Elliott School at George Washington University. ""Nothing came out of it except  Trump  flying in and being treated well  himself .""
Shambaugh points to the lavish dinners  honor guards at nearly every stop and the tea to which the president was treated in Beijing's Forbidden City as ""symbols"" that the Chinese and ""in fact  most Asian leaders  have figured out  Trump "" — by flattering his ego.
 Trump  reassured Japan's President Shinzo Abe and Prime Minister Moon Jae-In of South Korea of U.S. commitment; they in turn vowed to keep working toward the goal of a denuclearized North Korea and pledged some investments in the U.S.
"" He  did no harm "" says Shambaugh.
""All countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed ""  Trump  said after  he  returned.

4865,Trump pushes bipartisan immigration deal but renews demand on border wall,Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  urged lawmakers on Tuesday to find a bipartisan solution to protect thousands of young  undocumented immigrants from deportation but repeated  his  demand that any agreement must include funding for a border wall with Mexico.
At a White House meeting of Republican and Democratic lawmakers   Trump  said  he  would sign any bill that gives protection to young “Dreamer” immigrants as long as  it  had the border security protections  he  has sought.
“If you don’t have the wall  you don’t have security ”  Trump  told the lawmakers.
 Trump  and  his  fellow Republicans  who control the U.S. Congress  have been unable to reach agreement with Democrats on a deal to resolve the status of an estimated 700 000 young immigrants whose protection from potential deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  or DACA  program ends in early March.
Under pressure from immigrant groups ahead of midterm congressional elections in November  Democrats are reluctant to give ground to Trump on the issue of the wall - Trump’s central promise from the 2016 presidential campaign.
 Trump  put their fate in doubt in early September when  he  announced  he  was ending former President Barack Obama’s DACA program  which allowed them to legally live and work in the United States temporarily.
“Democrats are for security at the border ” Hoyer told Trump during the meeting. “There are obviously differences  however  Mr. President  on how you affect that.”
Trump  under pressure from some conservatives  repeated his demand that any DACA deal with Democrats must include ending “chain migration ” which could jeopardize the parents of Dreamers who are still in the United States illegally  and a visa lottery program.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  [TGT]urged lawmakers on Tuesday to find a bipartisan solution to protect thousands of young  undocumented immigrants from deportation but repeated  [TGT]  demand that any agreement must include funding for a border wall with Mexico.

4867,The Trump Administration Will Look Into Banning Bump Stocks,Trump,"President Trump directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft regulations banning bump stocks “very soon ” while the White House says it is keeping all options open on gun control.
In the first daily briefing since a Florida school shooting left 17 people dead  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that the Trump Administration has not put together a concrete plan.
Still  Sanders did offer a few policy and regulation areas that  President Trump  will look at in the coming weeks to try to untangle the problem of mass shootings in America.
“I can tell you that  the president  supports not having the use of bump stocks and that we expect further action on that in the coming days ” Sanders said Tuesday. The national spotlight turned to bump stocks—accessories that increase the rate of fire on semi-automatic weapons— in the wake of last fall’s Las Vegas shooting that took the lives of more than 50 people. Sanders said  Trump  a Justice Department and ATF review the regulation of bump stocks has been completed since then  and  she  expects “movement will take place on that shortly.”
“Today  I am directing the Department of Justice to dedicate all available resources to complete the review of the comments received  and  as expeditiously as possible  to propose for notice and comment a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machine-guns ”  Trump  said in a memo.
Since the shooting   Trump  has spoken more about mental illness as a cause of these events than gun laws. Sanders said Tuesday that the president is “very focused” on the issue  and that the White House is “working hand in hand with both the federal government as well as state and local law enforcement officials on what we legally can do” to address mental health and gun ownership.
Trump is scheduled to hold a listening session on Wednesday with parents  teachers and students who experienced the Parkland shooting or live nearby. “This is a listening session to see what could be done better  what the actual concerns of the students are  what they would like to see ” said Sanders. “One of the things the president wants to do is make sure that he sits down with a number of people from across all fronts.”","President Trump directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to craft regulations banning bump stocks “very soon ” while the White House says it is keeping all options open on gun control.

4868,Doctor says Trump is 6,Trump,"President Trump  left  and Tim Tebow. (Photos via Getty Images)
The results of  President Trump’s  first formal medical exam since taking office were announced Tuesday  and the big news was that the physician involved  Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson  said the 71-year-old president received a perfect score on a cognitive test. However  other announced results were also of interest  particularly to those who couldn’t help but notice that  Trump  was listed at 6-3 and 239 pounds.
Adding to some online observers’ skepticism that Trump’s measurements were accurate was the fact that 239 pounds  at 6-3  conveniently put his body mass index at 29.9 — just below the 30.0 threshold for him to be officially described as obese  rather than merely overweight. In any event  plenty of Internet users were happy to juxtapose photos of the president with those of athletes with similar listed heights and weights.

In fairness  those athletes have much more weight in sculpted muscle than Trump  whose body mass is distributed just a bit differently (also in fairness: this out-of-shape author is no one to talk). Jackson said that he has a goal for the president of losing 10-15 pounds through a regimen of diet and exercise  telling reporters  “He’s more enthusiastic about the diet part than the exercise part  but we’re going to do both.”
In general  though  Jackson was upbeat about Trump’s physical condition  prompting questions about how a septuagenarian man with such seemingly poor habits  including little apparent exercise apart from golfing (while driving in carts) and an affinity for greasy fast food  could fare so well in a thorough examination. “It’s called genetics ” the physician replied with a shrug.

4869,As U.S. stocks plummet  Trump goes silent on role in markets,Trump,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. stocks plunged on Monday   President Donald Trump  was speaking at an event in Ohio but noticeably not taking credit for the market despite doing so repeatedly when stocks were rising.
The stark contrast was a sign that  Trump  may be absorbing a tough message  underscored by former White House advisers  that American presidents traditionally have avoided commenting directly on Wall Street’s fickle trends.
Gene Sperling  a top economic adviser to Democratic former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama  said  Trump  erred in recent months by focusing so heavily on the stock market.
White House spokesman Raj Shah  in an adjustment to the administration’s message on stocks  told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to  Trump’s  speaking event in Ohio  “Look  markets do fluctuate in the short term. We all know that ... But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong and they’re headed in the right direction.”
(See the interactive graphic "" Trump  takes credit for stock market records"" here: tmsnrt.rs/2E4FmaQ )
Throughout a speech at a factory in  Blue Ash  Ohio  Trump  made no mention of stock markets. That departed sharply from past practice.
In his State of the Union address last week   Trump  said  “The stock market has smashed one record after another  gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time.”
“If the Democrats won the election  the stock market would have gone down 50 percent from where it was  and now look at the percentage increase. It’s a record increase ”  Trump  said.
Once the markets closed  the White House issued a statement saying  Trump ’s focus is “on our long-term economic fundamentals  which remain exceptionally strong  with strengthening U.S. economic growth  historically low unemployment  and increasing wages for American workers.”
The benchmark Dow Jones industrial average soared 42 percent between Election Day 2016  when  Trump  won the presidency  and  its  historic peak a week ago above 26 400.
The “ Trump  rally ” as some traders have dubbed it  has coincided with a sweeping tax code overhaul approved in December  which slashed corporate taxes  and a deregulation push.
The S&P 500 rose 34 percent from  Trump’s  election to  its  recent high.
 Trump  has also criticized  his  predecessor Obama’s effect on markets. In November 2012   Trump  tweeted  “The stock market and U.S. dollar are both plunging today.

4870,White House Decides Not To Impose New Sanctions On Russia : NPR,Trump,"The Trump administration  has told Congress a law passed last year meant to punish Moscow for interfering in U.S. elections is having an effect  even without new sanctions.
So  the Trump administration  has told Congress  it  does not need to impose new Russia-related sanctions  at least  not right now.  The administration  says a law passed last year that was meant to punish Moscow for meddling in U.S. elections is having an effect. Here's more from NPR diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen.
MICHELE KELEMEN  BYLINE: The deadline was Monday for  the Trump administration  to impose sanctions on anyone doing significant business with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors already blacklisted by the U.S. The State Department says it believes that the threat of additional sanctions - that is  the law itself - has disrupted several billion dollars in Russian defense deals. So officials say the law is already having a deterrent effect  and they see no need to impose sanctions.
The Trump administration had other reports due Monday under CAATSA  the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. That includes the so-called oligarchs list  the names of wealthy and influential Russians who are close to President Vladimir Putin. But some experts were unimpressed by the unclassified version  which gives few details other than the names and titles of Putin's advisers.
Still  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Ben Cardin  says he appreciates the administration's closed-door briefing on all of this. He's vowing to keep close watch to ensure that the Trump administration follows the law that he helped to draft. Eliot Engel  the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee  blasted the Trump administration for not imposing new sanctions and  in his words  letting Russia off the hook yet again.

 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : From this day forward  it's going to be only America First  America First.
KELLY: President Trump appears to be less comfortable dealing with America's traditional allies - you can look at some European leaders  for example - than with authoritarian regimes. And I wonder  A  would you agree with that? B  is it a problem?
MEAD: I think we have to limit that and say he's less comfortable with European allies. Part of it is that the European Union is sort of ideologically committed to an idea of a liberal world order where the rule of law is paramount  democratic peace theory and so on. And it's not I think so much that  Trump  hates democracy but that  Trump  doesn't believe that you can actually build a stable world on these foundations.
KELLY: What about what's been perhaps  his  most closely watched personal relationship? And I'm referring to  his  relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Have you been able to figure it out?
MEAD: That is  under Trump  U.S. policy is almost as anti-Russian as it can be at the strategic level. So modernize and rebuild your nuclear forces. Increase your military spending  forcing Russia either to compete in a league that it can't afford or to drop back.
But at the same time   Trump  possibly like other American presidents   has overestimated the role of atmospherics and had hoped to still have good relations with Russia even as  he  was taking a wrecking ball to the foundations of Russian power.
MEAD: ...Who were the two most important partners for us in Asia and  therefore  I think in the world. They have done a reasonable though not a great job working past some of the issues in U.S.-European relations - can't say that they've restored stability to the Middle East. They have not effectively communicated their position on energy  which I think is kind of a key to the  Trump  strategy. But I do think there's something very powerful going on there.
KELLY: Stay with energy for a second. Why do you think that's key  and how does  the Trump administration's policies on energy  perhaps play out and change the way that  it 's interacting with the rest of the world?
MEAD: I think for  Trump   the idea that America's newfound energy wealth - unconventional hydrocarbons  natural gas  so on - is changing the rules of world politics. It's reduced Russia's power. It's created an internal crisis in Iran. It is forcing Saudi Arabia in a way none of us have ever seen to rethink some of their basic assumptions. So to the extent that there is kind of a central vision in the Trump administration  I think it is this idea that America's energy dominance can be a positive force in the world  and that's something they want to work toward.
KELLY: Well  this speaks to the next thing I wanted to ask you  which is  how much has actually changed? We see a lot of rhetoric coming out of this White House. President  Trump   for example  threatens to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  He  walks right up to the line but so far hasn't stepped over it.
MEAD: Yeah. You don't - you can't turn it on the dot. In  the Trump administration 's case  I think  they  haven't appointed all of the officials that  they  would need to retool the government. So we're still operating  you know  on old hardware  so to speak.","How U.S. Foreign Policy Has Changed In  Trump 's First Year In Office

 President Trump  will meet North Korean defectors in the Oval Office on Friday  a provocative action meant to highlight human rights violations and one that could raise alarms in Pyongyang.
 Trump  is expected to meet with eight defectors — six who live in South Korea and two who live in the United States — two days after  he  punctuated  his  State of the Union address by praising Ji Seong-ho  a defector from North Korea who had been invited to watch the address from the first lady's box.  Ji  will be among the group at the White House on Friday.
“No regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea ”  Trump  said Tuesday night during the annual address to Congress. ""North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.""
The visit was arranged by Greg Scarlatoiu at the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea  a person familiar with the meeting said.  Trump  has sought to highlight the human costs of dictator Kim Jong Un's regime  but foreign policy experts warned that there are risks to such a strategy.
 Trump 's administration has said that  it  is continuing that policy. But the president's increasing rhetoric  including vows to use military power to ""totally destroy"" the North  and his personal denunciations of Kim have ramped up tensions on the peninsula. Experts said  Trump 's embrace of defectors could also be interpreted in Pyongyang as a threat.
“Meeting  them  in the Oval raises the question of whether the U.S. strategy is regime change ” said one foreign-policy expert who specializes in East Asia. “It could reduce the incentive to negotiate and potentially undercut efforts [of cooperation] with China. The real question is: Is North Korea strategy changing?”
“Today he lives in Seoul  where he rescues other defectors  and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most — the truth ”  Trump  said during  his  address to Congress. “Today  he  has a new leg  but Seong-ho  I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.”
 Ji  lifted  his  crutches as the audience of lawmakers and other guests applauded  in one of the most emotional moments of the speech.
Lee  who was in the audience in South Korea’s National Assembly when  Trump  delivered a speech there in November  plans to use her time with the president to urge him to stop China repatriating North Koreans who are caught escaping.
Torture and imprisonment is standard and some North Koreans are publicly executed  Lee will tell  Trump .
She will ask Trump to try to convince China not to send North Koreans back. “Mr. President  please help us to stop the repatriation in China and give North Korean people the freedom that they deserve ” she will say  according to remarks shared with the Post.","North Korean defector Ji Seong-ho raises his crutches as he is recognized by [TGT]during the State of the Union address on Jan. 30  2018.

4877,Has Trump botched the Palestinian deal already?,Trump,"President Trump  is not the only world leader who thinks the frozen Middle East peace process should be jarred loose. Nor is  he  the only one willing to use Jerusalem as a hammer.
 Vladimir Putin  took a swing from out of the blue in April  apparently hoping to break the international ice. Through  his  foreign ministry  the Russian autocrat said: “Moscow is deeply concerned about the situation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Palestine and Israel have not held political negotiations for nearly three years  and the situation on the ground has been deteriorating.”
Putin beat  Trump  to the punch  and his statement was sharper than the president’s speech Wednesday formalizing the long-held U.S. position that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. The Russian declaration was head-on: Two states will share one holy city.  Trump  buried the same reality just below the surface.  He  spoke of “Jerusalem” instead of “West Jerusalem.” But  he  added vaguely — yet unmistakably — that Israel will have only part of the city. “Specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem” will be negotiated   he  said.
These aren’t different meanings — only differences in style.  Trump  was cultivating a segment of  his  passionate base that views Jerusalem in messianic terms. To speak with them of shared ownership might create fears of a Rapture delayed. Putin  on the other hand  leads a country that has made tons of trouble for Israel over the years. He wants to improve the relationship  but he certainly feels no pressure to tiptoe.
 Trump  is fulfilling a promise to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital but  he 's unprepared for the consequences  says Post deputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl. Watch his argument in this clip from the weekly Opinions show  ""It's Only Thursday "" with fellow editorial board contributors Ruth Marcus and Quinta Jurecic. (The Washington Post)
Putin’s version was beckoning: Come  negotiate. You can have your Palestine  if only you will forget about erasing Israel. When Trump framed the message  it was goading. You better negotiate  because Israel is growing stronger  not weaker.
In the violent response to  Trump   compared with the chirping crickets that met Putin’s bombshell  we find proof that people would rather be coaxed than prodded. Also proof — no matter what  Trump  says about the world “laughing at us” — that U.S. presidents still command top billing.
But has  Trump  already botched the deal?
Reckless  impulsive  petulant   Trump  chose a few days before  his  Jerusalem statement to endorse three anti-Muslim videos posted to the Internet by a fringe group of Western racists. Simultaneously   he  was pushing for  his  anti-Muslim travel ban.
In our wired world  these insults were quickly known to every Palestinian in East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. They were known to every intellectual and political leader in Egypt and Jordan and Lebanon — indeed  the whole Arab world — whose influence might be felt in circles of Palestinian power.  Trump’s  insults were known among supporters of the Palestinian cause around the Mediterranean  in Europe  in North America  in Asia.
Does  Trump  think  they  will ignore  his  opportunistic hate-mongering? Laugh it off? This is the Middle East  not a raunchy roast at the Friar’s Club. If  Trump  is joking when  he  loads  his  Twitter app  no one gets it. Neither the key influencer nor the Palestinian in the street is likely to encourage Hamas and Fatah to sit at  Trump ’s table. How could they trust  him ?","[TGT]is not the only world leader who thinks the frozen Middle East peace process should be jarred loose.

4881,CONGRESSIONAL PANEL WANTS LAWMAKERS TO APPROVE NEW SPACE POLICY,Obama,"A Democratic-led House subcommittee voted unanimously to give President Obama the entire $4.2 billion that he requested for manned space exploration next year but blocked any expenditures before Congress itself approves a new roadmap for the NASA's future  expected later this year.
 The outcome represented a face-saving compromise by Democrats on the panel to provide Obama an early symbolic victory by awarding him money requested for NASA's marquee exploration programs as it simultaneously tied his hands until Congress takes further action.
 The 14-member panel of nine Democrats and five Republicans -- a fraction of the 435-member House -- agreed to provide NASA $19 billion requested by Obama in February. The panel  mindful of mounting concern over federal spending  reduced aspects of Obama's spending plan for NASA by cutting spending on space operations from a request of $4.9 billion to $4.5 billion and cutting aspects of exploration from $4.3 billion to $3.6 billion.
 The panel's action was the first time that lawmakers have voted on spending for NASA for the coming year since Obama proposed a major overhaul that included canceling the $108 billion program to return astronauts to the moon by 2020. Obama wants Congress to authorize NASA to spend $6 billion over the next five years to foster a commercial spacecraft industry as well as pouring additional billions into new technologies useful for projected deep space exploration.","A Democratic-led House subcommittee voted unanimously to give [TGT] the entire $4.2 billion that [TGT] requested for manned space exploration next year but blocked any expenditures before Congress itself approves a new roadmap for the NASA's future  expected later this year.

4883,THE INFLUENCE GAME: Chamber at odds with Obama,Obama,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- If President Barack Obama wants to take the measure of his opposition  he only has to glance across Lafayette Park from the White House.

 Evan Tracey  who tracks political advertising as president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group  said that as of the first week of August  the amount spent on ads supporting an Obama-styled plan totaled more than $22 million to more than $8 million against it.
 One of the leading spenders against Obama's plan is Conservatives for Patients Rights  a group led and largely financed by Rick Scott  a former hospital executive. Scott was chief executive of Columbia/HCA  a health care company that pleaded guilty to overbilling charges.

4885,Bowe Bergdahl deal compromised US national security and President Obama should be held accountable,Obama,"In 2014  President Obama  attempted to cover Bergdahl with the achievement of a war hero  even inviting  his  Idaho based parents to the Rose Garden to celebrate news of  his  release.  President Obama  pointed out at the time that five Taliban leaders were freed from Guantanamo so that Bergdahl could be released from captivity. To gild the lily  National Security Adviser  Susan Rice  said Bergdahl served “the United States with honor and distinction.”
 President Obama  had all of this information at  his  disposal before  he  made a deal releasing Bergdahl. Why then did  he  mislead the American people? The answer can be found in  the president’s  desire to satisfy antiwar liberals keen on emptying Gitmo. At the Rose Garden event  the president  admitted as much when  he  said  “We’re committed to winding down the war in Afghanistan and closing Gitmo.” It is instructive that the CIA has evidence at least three of the released Taliban leaders have returned to the battlefield.
One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama.
The president’s dissimulation clearly violated the military code and has had a profound effect on morale. Those I know in the military invariably ask how a president could honor a deserter when he was fully aware of his prior actions. This  of course  wasn’t the first time President Obama allowed politics to determine a course of ethical behavior  but it may be among the most egregious examples. One intelligence official argued: “It’s probably a tie as to who is the bigger traitor” – Bergdahl or Obama. With a political ecology in which standards have been debased  many have attempted to rationalize President Obama’s decision. In my judgment  however  his actions that jeopardized national security should be fully investigated and  where blame exists  the full weight of public opinion should be employed to condemn the president and his assistants.","In 2014  [TGT]attempted to cover Bergdahl with the achievement of a war hero  even inviting  [TGT]  Idaho based parents to the Rose Garden to celebrate news of  his  release.

4887,Catholic groups file suit over HHS birth control mandate,Obama,"Dozens of Catholic universities  dioceses and other institutions filed lawsuits in courts around the country on Monday (May 21) in a coordinated effort  spearheaded by the U.S. hierarchy and Catholic conservatives  to overturn the Obama administration’s contraception mandate plan.
“This filing is about the freedom of a religious organization to live its mission  and its significance goes well beyond any debate about contraceptives ” said Notre Dame’s president  the Rev. John Jenkins  who famously awarded President Obama an honorary degree in 2009 despite anger from U.S. bishops.
The Obama administration and its allies  including some Catholic groups  reject those assertions and say a proposed compromise to the mandate effectively bypasses any entanglement in birth control coverage by faith-based groups.
In addition  the part of the mandate that deals with religious groups does not go into effect for more than a year  and the Obama administration is currently processing feedback from Catholic groups — including many who filed lawsuits — on how to accommodate their concerns in the final regulation.
While the lawsuits effectively raise the pressure on  the Obama administration  in the ongoing negotiations — while raising the profile of the hierarchy’s religious liberty campaign this summer — the filings also prompted questions about how united the hierarchy is in challenging  the Obama administration  on the contraception mandate.","Dozens of Catholic universities  dioceses and other institutions filed lawsuits in courts around the country on Monday (May 21) in a coordinated effort  spearheaded by the U.S. hierarchy and Catholic conservatives  to overturn the [TGT] administration’s contraception mandate plan.

4888,Irrational Obama,Obama,"The three-member Republican majority at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reversed course on a number of the Obama board's most controversial rulings as Chairman Philip Miscimarra's term ended reports the Washington Free Beacon's Bill McMorris.
However  the NLRB's decisions  while a major boost for employers  should not be seen through the same prism of other aspects of the president's de-regulation agenda claims McMorris. While Trump has used the power of the pen to advance pipeline expansions and rein in regulators at Environmental Protection Agency  labor policy has largely focused on resetting long-standing precedent that  Obama's labor board  overturned.
""What  the board  has now done is restore some of the norms [of labor law]. The radical changes all occurred over the previous eight years "" Rick Grimaldi  a member of the Labor Relations Practice Group at Fisher Phillips told McMorris.
Last week  the board  voted 3-2 to overturn a controversial 2015 decision holding employers liable for labor violations committed by franchisees or subcontractors. McMorris reports  the Obama board  threw out decades of precedent that only held the parent company liable if they directly controlled the employment conditions that led to an apparent violation of worker rights.
While the ruling was a welcome development for the franchise industry  the board also overturned an Obama era policy that affected all employers and could prove the most important development as the Trump administration heads into 2018 claims McMorris. The board ruled to rein in agency regulators' ability to police employee handbooks. Beginning in 2013  the agency adopted the view that any rule in a rulebook—regardless of whether it played a part in worker's complaint—could be construed as a violation of federal labor law.
""They [Obama's NLRB] just wanted to include more people in the scope of their power  to increase their authority over the workplace "" he said. ""They were acting like little emperors.""
Charles Caulkins  an attorney at Fisher Phillips based out of Florida  said the 2013 employee handbook guidance represented an extreme shift even for a partisan agency like the NLRB  which is designed to seat three members of the president's party and two from the opposition. The GOP-controlled board's reversal of so many major accomplishments policy changes from the  Obama  era should give future board members pause before overturning long-lasting precedent.
""I don't think I've ever seen the pendulum swing so far in one direction … I think the NLRB is going to continue to try and pull back some of the more dramatic decisions "" Caulkins said of the  Obama  board. ""I think all of us—management and union—would agree we want a less political agency.""","The three-member Republican majority at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) reversed course on a number of [TGT]'s most controversial rulings as Chairman Philip Miscimarra's term ended reports the Washington Free Beacon's Bill McMorris.

4891,More Americans blame Republicans than Democrats for potential government shutdown Post,Trump,"By a 20-point margin  more Americans blame President Trump and Republicans rather than Democrats for a potential government shutdown  according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
A 48 percent plurality says  Trump  and congressional Republicans are mainly responsible for the situation resulting from disagreements over immigration laws and border security  while 28 percent fault Democrats. A sizable 18 percent volunteer that both parties are equally responsible. Political independents drive the lopsided margin of blame  saying by 46 to 25 percent margin that Republicans and  Trump  are responsible for the situation.
The Post-ABC poll finds Democrats are more united in blaming Republicans for the situation than vice versa. A 78 percent majority of Democrats say  Trump  and congressional Republicans are mainly responsible for the potential government shutdown  while a smaller 66 percent of Republicans blame Democrats in Congress. One in seven Republicans  14 percent  say  Trump  and Republicans are to blame.
Public opinion ahead of Fridayâs deadline is similar to attitudes at the end of the 2013 government shutdown. A Post-ABC poll after it ended found 53 percent of Americans said Republicans were mainly responsible for the shutdown  compared with 29 percent who blamed President Obama. The 24 percentage-point margin of greater blame for Republicans then is slightly larger than the 20-point blame margin for  Trump  and Republicans in the new poll.
The new poll finds Hispanic adults say by a roughly 3 to 1 margin that Republicans are mainly responsible for a potential government shutdown  with 60 percent blaming  Trump  and Republicans while 19 percent blame Democrats. Similarly  61 percent of adults under age 30 say  Trump  and Republicans are mainly responsible for the situation  higher than other age groups.","By a 20-point margin  more Americans blame President Trump and Republicans rather than Democrats for a potential government shutdown  according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.

4892,Is Trump Drowning Out Other News?,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  speaks to members of the media after  he  returned to the White House from Florida on September 14th  2017. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)
But that coverage comes at a cost.  The president  is hardly the only important political actor. Congress gets far less attention  even if it is the body actually developing most of the national policies that will affect Americans. State and local governments get paltry coverage in comparison  although the work they do has the most direct effect on our daily lives.
This seems particularly relevant in the  Donald Trump  era. Even by presidential standards   Trump  is unusually successful in drawing media coverage.  He  gets coverage for the usual things presidents doâforeign travel  addresses and rallies  bill signings  etc.âbut also for tweets and incendiary statements most other presidents simply never made. Yet newspapers aren't getting bigger and 24-hour news channels can't add additional hours to their days. Are other stories losing out?
Now  there are plausible causes for this trend other than  Trump 's attention-grabbing behavior. It's possible the issue just isn't as salient now because it's seen as an ongoing matter rather than a new one. It's possible the issue drew more attention in the recent past because Barack Obama  as an African American  was expected to do more to address the issue of police killings of black citizens. Nonetheless  the trend is consistent with the idea that more coverage of  Trump  leads to less coverage of everything else.
A concern expressed repeatedly by observers of the  Trump  presidency is that most of the crises he has faced have been of his own making. How will he behave once he faces a challenge of office that he didn't create? In fact  he's been facing challenges all along. The killing of unarmed civilians by police officers remains a serious crisis  as does North Korea  opioid abuse  climate change  flooding  and other matters. To the extent  Trump  has an approach to dealing with such crises  it seems to be to draw attention away from them.","[TGT] speaks to members of the media after   [TGT]   returned to the White House from Florida on September 14th  2017.

4895,Why is Sebastian Gorka still in the White House? Because Trump loves his TV performances.,Trump,"Sebastian Gorka  a deputy assistant to  President Trump   left the administration on Aug. 25. (Sarah Parnass Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post)
Of all of  President Trumpâs  close advisers  there is one who perhaps best typifies the worst of  Trumpâs  combative  us-vs.-them  fact-free style: Sebastian Gorka  a deputy assistant to the president who shares his views that Muslims are the enemy  bellicosity is strength and the news media are out to get the president.
For months  Gorka received heavy scrutiny over his ties to far-right  anti-Semitic groups in Hungary  leading to widespread rumors last spring that he was going to be dismissed from the White House. But not only has his White House tenure endured  he has continued to be a ubiquitous  Trump  surrogate in the media.
Why is Gorka still there? The best explanation is that  Trump  loves Gorkaâs television performances  whether they are in the Trump-friendly confines of Fox News  or in the hostile territory of MSNBC or CNN  where Gorka plays the anti-âfake newsâ pit bull for his boss.
Gorka has been hitting the airwaves again this week  defending Trumpâs unscripted âfire and furyâ bellicosity against North Korea  undercutting Secretary of State Rex Tillersonâs effort to scale back the presidentâs rhetoric  and strongly hinting  Trump  is ready to go to war with Pyongyang.
In Gorkaâs world  only he truly understands not just what the president wants  but also that the president is right about everything. Gorka has been widely mocked by national security experts as a fringe player with scant credentials for his purported counterterrorism post. But he has a single piece of expertise that has turned him into a favorite  Trump  surrogate: a willingness to defend  Trump  against any perceived enemy  and to project Trumpâs us-vs.-them mentality to the world â regardless of what more senior administration officials or anyone with actual expertise thinks.
Gorkaâs willingness to prostrate himself for  Trump  appears to have no bounds  including suggesting that the president of the United States is willing to launch a nuclear war. When pressed today on the BBC about his suggestions that  Trump  would order a military strike  Gorka maintained  â Donald Trump  has been unequivocal â  he  will use any appropriate measures to protect the United States and  her  citizens.â  He  repeatedly refused to provide further details but did remind the audience â and perhaps that audience was merely  Trump himself  â that âthereâs only one person in this great country that controls our nuclear arsenal.â
Gorka sent chills down the spines of his British audience today â including among some British members of Parliament â as he seemed to be paying no mind to how Trumpâs Cabinet and advisers are scrambling to scale back his reckless war threats.
Gorka further defended  Trump  this week on MSNBC  when asked why  the president  has not yet condemned the bombing of a mosque in Minnesota. âWeâve had a series of crimes committed  alleged hate crimes by right-wing individuals in the last six months that actually turned out to be propagated by the left â Gorka said. When pressed on the fact that  Trump  has been quick to condemn attacks allegedly perpetrated by Muslims  Gorka retorted: âSometimes an attack is unequivocally clear for what it is.â But the mosque bombing in Minnesota  Gorka suggested  could have been committed by âpeople who fake hate crimes.â
Yet  it seems  one very powerful person does want Gorka to stay: the president. As Jonathan Swan has reported  although some West Wing aides consider Gorkaâs media appearances âan embarrassment â his No. 1 fan is none other than  Trump himself .  Trump âs admiration seems to stem largely from Gorkaâs eagerness to jettison any semblance of custom or charm when appearing on networks  Trump  considers hostile to  his  interests. âGorkaâs stock has soared as  President Trump  has watched  him  on various cable channels fighting with the hosts and accusing them of being part of the âfake news industrial complex â â Swan reported.
Indeed  Gorkaâs willingness to disparage any media that dare question  Trump  is what helped make  him  a regular presence on  Fox   where  he  is frequently called upon to do just that  including by  Trump  friend Sean Hannity. Not even the Soviet Unionâs media was that bad  Gorka once told  Hannity   speaking about CNN  which has become a regular target of  the president himself .
Since for  Trump  all that matters is defending  him   it seems that Gorka will remain in the White House as long as his aggressive defenses of  Trump  continue making him happy.","Sebastian Gorka  a deputy assistant to   [TGT] left the administration on Aug. 25.

""We need to harden our schools  "" President Trump  said at a school safety meeting on Feb. 22  saying that gun-free zones are like ""going in for the ice cream"" for attackers. ( Reuters)
President Trump  aligned  Â­himself  with gun rights advocates on Thursday  signaling that  his  top priority would be arming hundreds of thousands of teachers across the nation in response to last weekâs deadly school shooting in South Florida.
On Twitter and at a White House event   Trump  argued that allowing teachers to carry concealed weapons would deter future shooters and âsolve the problem instantly.â
âWe have to harden our schools  not soften them â  the president  said  asserting that for potential shooters  schools that advertise their status as gun-free zones are âlike going in for the ice cream. Thatâs like  âHere I am  take me.â â
A day after promising a room full of students  teachers and parents that âweâre going to do something about this horrible situation â  Trump  further embraced arming some teachers â a proposal backed by the National Rifle Association  whose leaders he called âGreat American Patriots.â
 Trump  continued to pledge to âtake actionâ Thursday  with aides describing the president as being in a âlistening phaseâ that is Â­expected to result in legislative proposals and suggestions for policy changes at the state level. He met with attorneys general and other state and local leaders Thursday after an emotionally raw meeting Wednesday that included family members of those killed in Parkland.
White House spokesman Raj Shah said  Trump  remains open to a range of actions  but one step long sought by gun-control advocates â a ban on semiautomatic rifles such as the AR-15 used by the shooter in Parkland â is not under active consideration.
The strategy of arming teachers and other school personnel that animated  Trump  on Thursday has many critics  including some law enforcement officers and the countryâs largest teachers lobby. It was also undercut somewhat Thursday by news that the sheriffâs deputy who was on-site and assigned to protect students at Stoneman Douglas took a defensive position outside the school and did not enter the building where the shooter was killing students and teachers.
Besides calling for an influx of concealed weapons at schools   Trump  continued to float the ideas of improving a federal database used for background checks and raising the minimum age for purchasing semiautomatic weapons to 21 from 18.
The latter proposal has drawn opposition from the NRA  a group that spent more than $30 million in support of  Trump âs 2016 presidential bid. On Thursday  the president predicted that the NRA would come on board.

âI donât think Iâll be going up against them. . . . Theyâre good people â said  Trump   who spoke to a top NRA official over the weekend  according to Shah.
 His  assessment came amid an aggressive push by the NRA to blunt an emotionally charged wave of calls for new gun restrictions with speeches and videos that included a claim that news media outlets âlove mass shootingsâ because they boost ratings.
In a statement  Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused the NRA of âspewing pathetic  out of touch ideasâ and challenged  Trump  and other Republicans to âfinally buck the NRA and get something done.â

When it comes to filling jobs dealing with complex science  environment and health issues  the  Trump  administration is nominating people with fewer science academic credentials than their Obama predecessors. And it's moving slower as well.
Of 43  Trump  administration nominees in science-related positions â including two for Health and Human Services secretary â almost 60 percent did not have a master's degree or a doctorate in a science or health field  according to an Associated Press analysis. For their immediate predecessors in the Obama administration  it was almost the opposite: more than 60 percent had advanced science degrees.
Including now-resigned Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price  a medical doctor  the number of political appointees with a doctorate in science or a medical degree dropped 21 percent from Obama's 19 to  Trump 's 15 in those equivalent positions. And when it comes to master's degrees  the number decreased one-third from 27 in Obama to 18 in  Trump .
 Trump  administration officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
None of the seven  Trump  energy science-oriented nominees â including the undersecretary for science  who did research while in the U.S. Navy â has even a master's degree in a science field  although some are lawyers and have MBAs. Five of their Obama predecessor's had master's degrees in science field and four had science doctorates â not including the Obama deputy Energy secretary  who had a doctorate in international relations. The two Obama Energy secretaries both had doctorates in physics  and Steven Chu was a Nobel prize winner in physics. Trump Energy Secretary Rick Perry has a bachelor's degree in animal science and was a former governor.
In 35 percent of the 65 senate-confirmable positions that deal with science and environment  the Trump administration hasn't nominated someone yet  including all four top positions at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Of the 23 positions that President Donald Trump hasn't nominated anyone yet to fill after 10 months  Barack Obama had picked nominees in 18 of those posts by the same time in 2009.","Interested in   [TGT]  ?

4901,George W. Bush just laid a major smackdown on Trumpism,Donald Trump,"The 43rd president of the United States -- and the last Republican to hold the office before  Donald Trump  -- didn't mention the 45th president by name in his speech at the George W. Bush Institute. But  Trump  -- and  his  views -- were ever-present in the former President's address.
The two speeches  taken together  amount to a verbal lapel-shaking by Bush and McCain of the Republican Party they have led over the past two decades. ""Wake up!"" Bush and McCain are saying to their party. ""What  Trump  represents is neither Republican nor conservative.  It  is  Trump . Which is fine for  Trump  but far less fine for the medium-to-long-term health of the Grand Old Party.""
There will be some who question Bush's motives. ( Trump   via Twitter  may be one of them.) After all   Trump  savaged ""low-energy"" Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign. And the Bush family is literally one of the cornerstones of the Republican political establishment. Of course they don't like that someone like  Trump  is overthrowing them -- and their failed policies and political tactics!
That belief  which can be traced in a relatively solid line from the first president to the 43rd  was broken with  Trump 's victory.  Trump  painted a picture of a grim and failing country  one in which the only true path forward was to start focusing more on ourselves and a whole lot less on the rest of the world.
 Trump 's policy priorities -- a travel ban  building a wall along the southern border  repeal and replacement of Obamacare  pulling out of the Paris climate accords -- all function as a different notes in that same chord. The American Dream is almost dead.  Only Trump  can revive  it  -- with a singular focus on looking out for number one again.
It's easy to paint Trumpism as solely a rejection of Obama's presidency. But to do so would be to ignore the degree to which  Trump  has sought to undo Bush's focus on on free trade agreements as a way to guard against global protectionism  his belief in the need for comprehensive immigration reform as consistent with the founding ideals of the country and his unwillingness to paint Islam with the broad brush of terrorism.
Those are powerful words. The question is whether  Trump  -- or the Republican Party  he  is remaking in  his  image -- are listening.","The 43rd president of the United States -- and the last Republican to hold the office before  [TGT] -- didn't mention the 45th president by name in his speech at the George W.

4902,Trump meets with GOP senators on tax reform amid renewed feuds,Trump,"President Trump  met Tuesday with Senate Republicans in hopes of forging the kind of party unity needed to pass tax reform and other legislative goals before next yearâs congressional elections  even as  he  and key lawmakers clashed on the sidelines.
In the lead-up to Tuesday's meeting   Trump  and Sen. Bob Corker  R-Tenn.  reignited a simmering feud with a round of barbed insults.
Corker and Sen. John McCain  R-Ariz. -- another occasional  Trump  adversary -- both emerged from the meeting Tuesday afternoon without answering questions from reporters.
Louisiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy told reporters that  Trump  and Corker did not speak directly during the meeting  which he described as ""very cordial."" Kennedy said the meeting ended with standing ovations.
However  he said  Trump  set no deadline for Congress to send a tax bill to his desk.
""We had a very  very good meeting "" Kennedy said  urging  Trump  to travel across the country to sell a tax plan. Asked repeatedly about the Corker feud  Kennedy said there were no conversations about  Trump 's tweets.
With the tax plan   Trump  is still trying for a major legislative win after Republicans failed this summer to pass legislation to dismantle ObamaCare. The Senate passed a related budget plan last week -- but specifics on the tax legislation are still being worked out  including over tax rates and provisions for popular benefits like pretax 401(k) contributions.
But hopes of unity faced another setback Tuesday morning when Corker reignited his feud with  Trump .
 Trump  responded with a series of vitriolic tweets including: âIsnât it sad that lightweight Senator Bob Corker  who couldnât get re-elected in the Great State of Tennessee  will now fight Tax Cuts plus!â
 The president  appeared last week to settle  his  differences with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R-Ky.  emerging from a White House meeting to say his relationship with the Senate Republican leader is âbetter than ever.â
However  McCain and other GOP senators still appear at odds with  Trump   who essentially needs consensus from the 52-member Senate Republican conference to get a simple 51-vote majority to pass tax reform and most other legislative proposals.
McCain on Sunday took a swipe at  Trump  when he said on C-SPAN that the U.S. military has âdrafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say they had a bone spur.""
 Trump  had five draft deferments  including one granted after  he  submitted a physician's letter stating  he  suffered from such spurs in  his  feet.
House Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  said Tuesday  he  expects  his  chamber to have its final tax bill ready by the Thanksgiving holiday but that the Senate is going to be âa little slower â which would mean the final package would likely be ready by yearâs end.
âAt the end of the day â¦ Bobâs going to vote for tax reform because he knows itâs in the best interest of Americans. So put this Twitter dispute aside â Ryan also said about the Corker-Trump feud.

4904,Trump Allies Allege Mueller Obtained Trump Transition Emails Unlawfully : NPR,Trump,"Trump Allies Allege Mueller  Obtained Trump Transition Emails Unlawfully
Opponents of special counsel Robert Mueller ramped up their attacks over the weekend with a new claim that he improperly collected  thousands of emails from President Trump's transition team  and is using  them  as an illegitimate basis for much of his investigation.
Mueller's office said  his team  has obtained all the evidence it's using in its investigation properly. And Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  who appointed him  told Congress last week that he monitors Mueller's operation closely and has seen nothing improper.
This weekend's dispute is the latest chapter in an ongoing campaign by  Trump 's Republican allies against Mueller and  his team .
Upon his return to the White House from an overnight trip to Camp David   the president  weighed in on the controversy surrounding  his  transition team's emails  telling reporters  ""It's not looking good.""
 Trump  added:
The anti-Mueller camp raised the stakes on Saturday by charging that Mueller had improperly obtained tens of thousands of  emails from as many as a dozen accounts associated with the Trump transition   and investigators had been using information they contained in their investigation.
 The emails  were stored with General Services Administration  a government agency that does a range of things like providing office space for federal employees. It also hosted the incoming administration's email system  which ended in ""@ptt.gov"" â or presidential transition team.
The special counsel reportedly got the email trove from the GSA  not from  Trump  For America  a still-functioning arm of  Trump 's transition team.
The special counsel's office pushed back on the characterizations that  the emails  were obtained unlawfully. In a statement Sunday  spokesperson Peter Carr said:
But a lawyer for the  Trump  transition on Saturday sent a letter to two congressional committees arguing that the materials were acquired in a way that was ""unlawful.""
 Also on Saturday  Kory Langhofer  a general counsel for Trump  For America  sent a letter to chairs of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
In the letter  obtained by Politico   Langhofer  calls the emails ""private  privileged materials "" not government property  and informs the committees of what  he  described as ""unlawful conduct that undermines the Presidential Transition Act of 1963.""
 Langhofer  went on to say:
 Langhofer  also asserts in the letter sent to the chairs of the congressional committees that ""TFA owned and controlled the PTT emails and data"" adding that ""GSA had no right to access or control the records but was simply serving as TFA's records custodian.""
Complicating matters is that  Langhofer  said in the memo that there was an understanding that TFA was the custodian of the emails.  He  said the agreement was laid out in June before a lawyer at GSA  Richard Beckler  a  Trump  appointee  who has since died.","Trump Allies Allege Mueller  Obtained Trump Transition Emails Unlawfully

The anti-Mueller camp raised the stakes on Saturday by charging that Mueller had improperly obtained tens of thousands of  [TGT] and investigators had been using information they contained in their investigation.
  [TGT] were stored with General Services Administration  a government agency that does a range of things like providing office space for federal employees.  [TGT]  also hosted the incoming administration's email system  which ended in ""@ptt.gov"" â or presidential transition team.
The special counsel reportedly got the email trove from the GSA  not from   [TGT]   For America  a still-functioning arm of  Trump 's transition team.
The special counsel's office pushed back on the characterizations that   [TGT] were obtained unlawfully. In a statement Sunday  spokesperson Peter Carr said:
But a lawyer for the   [TGT] transition on Saturday sent a letter to two congressional committees arguing that the materials were acquired in a way that was ""unlawful.""
 Also on Saturday  Kory Langhofer  a general counsel for  [TGT] For America  sent a letter to chairs of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
In the letter  obtained by Politico   Langhofer  calls the emails ""private  privileged materials "" not government property  and informs the committees of what  he  described as ""unlawful conduct that undermines the Presidential Transition Act of 1963.""
 Langhofer  went on to say:
 Langhofer  also asserts in the letter sent to the chairs of the congressional committees that ""TFA owned and controlled the PTT emails and data"" adding that ""GSA had no right to access or control the records but was simply serving as TFA's records custodian.""
Complicating matters is that  Langhofer  said in the memo that there was an understanding that TFA was the custodian of the emails.  He  said the agreement was laid out in June before a lawyer at GSA  Richard Beckler  a  Trump  appointee  who has since died.",Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral

On the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration  the federal government is in a partial shutdown  but it's still unclear which party will ultimately be blamed.
DAVIS: Yeah. I mean  there's reason to be skeptical that shutting down the government will have an impact on the party that's seen as doing it. As you said  in the 2013 shutdown  that was seen as being led by Senator Ted Cruz  a Republican from Texas. And the following election  the midterm year  Republicans won big. I still think one of the biggest factors in these election climates is the president's approval rating. And right now   President Trump    his  approval ratings are about 38 percent. That's the lowest point of any president at this stage of this presidency.
And I think this is really important context because  President if Trump's approval rating  right now is 58 percent  Democrats probably wouldn't be feeling as emboldened as they are to have this confrontation with  him . And I also think  you know  across the board  there's this recognition that  right now  the news cycle and the pace of the news happens so fast that if they resolve this shutdown in a few days  is it really still going to be a motivating force come November?","On  Trump 's First Anniversary  Another First: Why This Shutdown Is Different

4907,Donald Trump Made It Easier for Mentally Ill People to Buy Guns,Donald Trump,"President Trump  said the Texas church shooting was largely a âmental healthâ problem  but at the beginning of  his  presidency  he  rolled back a regulation that would have made it harder for people with histories of mental illness to purchase guns.
In February 2017   Trump  signed a bill that undid a regulation from Barack Obamaâs presidency which said the Social Security Administration would have to report certain mentally ill recipients and people deemed unfit to handle their own financial affairs to the national background check database  NBC reports. The Obama Administration said the rule would have added 75 000 names to the database.
The National Rifle Association  on the other hand  cheered  Trump  rescinding the rule as a win for Second Amendment rights. Other supporters of Trumpâs action  like Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa  argued that the regulation infringed upon civil liberties and took away gun rights without due process of law. âIf a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness â Grassley said  âthen the government should have to prove it â NPR reports.
Responding to Sundayâs mass shooting at a church in South Texas  which left at least 26 people dead and 20 others injured   Trump  said  âI think that mental health is your problem here.â  He  added  âWe have a lot of mental health problems in our country  as do other countries.

4908,Delingpole: Donald Trump Trolls Londonistan Like a Boss...,Donald Trump,"Yesterday I wrote to the Prime Minister asking her to ban Donald Trump from entering the United Kingdom on account of his support for far-right groups in this country. pic.twitter.com/K8iC5yAJTR â Chris Bryant (@RhonddaBryant) November 30  2017
Donald Trump  as many of us here know  is a much underrated figure in certain quarters.
What they misunderstand about  Trump  is the scale of  his  ambitions and the true nature of  his  mission.
As I argue in this weekâs Spectator   he  represents the same revolt of the masses against the liberal elite we saw with Brexit.  His  mission is vital:
That mission  domestically  is to Make America Great Again. But  his  ambitions  I believe  are even greater than that. As  he  outlined in  his  brilliant Warsaw speech   he  sees  himself  as the defender of not just the free world  but of western civilisation itself. âWe write symphonies. We pursue innovation. We celebrate our ancient heroes  embrace our timeless traditions and customs  and always seek to explore and discover brand-new frontiers. We reward brilliance. We strive for excellence  and cherish inspiring works of art that honour God. We treasure the rule of law and protect the right to free speech and free expression. We empower women as pillars of our society and of our success. We put faith and family  not government and bureaucracy  at the centre of our lives. And we debate everything. We challenge everything.â
It might seem a stretch to argue that  Trump âs recent trio of trolling retweets of Muslims-behaving-badly videos have much to do with this noble mission.
But cometh the man  cometh the hour.  President Trump  is no ordinary leader and  he  most certainly does not play by the conventional rules.
A key facet of  his  modus operandi is the way  he  manages to bypass a generally hostile media and speak directly to  his  constituency â essentially ordinary people whoâve had just about enough of politically correct nonsense â using social media.
So  cut to the chase  what was  Trump  doing with these tweets?
First  letâs just establish what  he  was NOT doing:
Winning the hearts and minds of radical Muslims; making liberals love and respect  him  more; getting nice coverage in the Guardian and the New York Times; persuading Never Trumpers that they might have misjudged  him ; winning over Theresa May and the rest of the faux-Conservative political class.
No.  Trump  doesnât give a damn for any of these people. (And who can blame  him ?)
Instead  he  was sending a message to the people  he  cares about: all those ordinary people out there  not just in the U.S. but in Europe and beyond  who are shocked  appalled  scared by the way their countries are slowly (or quite quickly in the case of some countries  Sweden  for example) surrendering to Islam; who feel betrayed by the pusillanimity of their political leaders and let down by the failure of most of their media to report on the rapes and the sexual grooming and the violence being committed disproportionately by Muslims  both immigrants and home-grown radicals; who feel unable to speak â except in embarrassed whispers â about their fears about being stabbed or machine-gunned or blown up or mown down by yet another jihadist simply for the crime of going about their daily  Western life; who bitterly resent being tarred as Islamophobic or xenophobic or uncaring when all they want is to be allowed to live their life in peace in a country whose traditions  laws and cultural values remain the ones they grew up with and which make their homeland worth living in.
a) âI heard some people on the BBC tell me that Britain First are far right and far right is  like  the worst thing ever. So by retweeting them Donald Trump was literally endorsing fascism!â
The U.S. was nearly as bad  of course  till  Trump  came along and said: âEnough is enough.â Which  of course  is one of the main reasons he is now president. He understood  as so many of our chatterati still do not  that there is a yawning gulf between where our political class are on the subject of immigration and Islam  and where the man and woman in the street are.","Yesterday I wrote to the Prime Minister asking her to ban  [TGT]  from entering the United Kingdom on account of his support for far-right groups in this country. pic.twitter.com/K8iC5yAJTR â Chris Bryant (@RhonddaBryant) November 30  2017

The pollster analysis showed  Trump 's approval average is not only the lowest for a first-year president  it ranks among the 10 worst for any president in any year since Gallup began regularly measuring job approval in 1945.
 Trump  netted a 38.4 percent approval rating average for  his  first year  slightly more than 10 percentage points lower than any other elected president's first-year average  the pollster reported.
Gallup reported  Trump  began his presidency behind the eight ball  with a job approval rating below 50 percent  the lowest for a president at his inaugural. The ratings eroded afterward but then stabilized between 36-37 percent  Gallup said.

4910,Trump attends civil rights museum opening; black leaders stay away,Donald Trump,"JACKSON  Miss. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump flew to Mississippi on Saturday to attend the opening of a civil rights museum  but his visit was marred by the absence of top African-American leaders who stayed away in protest of his policies and record on race relations.
 Trump  toured the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and delivered brief remarks  paying tribute to African-Americans who fought institutionalized racism  including Medgar Evers  the civil rights activist who was murdered outside his home in Jackson in 1963.
âWe want our country to be a place where every child from every background can grow up free from fear  innocent of hatred and surrounded by love  opportunity and hope â  Trump  said in prepared remarks.
Referring to Evers and other civil rights leaders showcased in the museum   Trump  said: âToday we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice. We pray for inspiration from their example.â
 Trump  acknowledged Eversâ wife Myrlie and brother Charles in the audience.

The two men also cited Trumpâs âdisparaging comments about women  the disabled  immigrants and National Football League playersâ and said  the president  had shown disrespect to those who fought for civil rights in Mississippi.
However  U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson  who is black and ran against  Trump  in the early 2016 Republican presidential primaries before dropping out  accompanied  the president  on  his  tour of the museum.
In August   Trump  unleashed a firestorm of criticism  including from Republicans and a top adviser in  his  administration  for saying that both left- and right-wing protesters were at fault for violence at a white supremacist-led rally in Charlottesville  Virginia  where one woman died.
White House spokesman Raj Shah said on Friday ahead of the visit that the civil rights movement was about fighting intolerance  hatred and bigotry and that  Trump  intended to honor the leaders of that struggle.

4912,Trumpâs 'fake news' awards win the prize for flops,Donald Trump,"By the time he got around to presenting his long-promised â2017 Fake New Awards â even President Donald Trump seemed to be losing interest in the event.
After tweeting a link to his list of winning or  if you prefer  losing journalists and news organizations last Wednesday night   Trump  tweeted another message that sounded almost apologetic: âDespite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage â  he  tweeted  âthere are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of!â
With that sweet little air-kiss to the media that his awards list dumps on   Trump  gave away a reality of Trump World: As much as  he  attacks the âfake â âlyingâ or âcorruptâ news media â and unapologetically picks up Twitter material from Fox News programs â  he  also signals to reporters that  as in the Corleone family in âThe Godfatherâ books and movies  itâs just business; donât take it personally.
 He  still picks up the phone and offers exclusives to the âfailing New York Timesâ (which really isnât) or other mainstream media as it suits  his  purpose.
Let us not forget that the wealthy real estate developer also spent many years starring in  his  own reality TV show  âThe Apprentice â and performing in the WWE  among other adventures. In a way   Trump âs experience behind and in front of cameras is so extensive that  for  him   taking on the role of media critic sounds almost like a conflict of interest.
And considering  his  deplorable record of issuing âalternative facts â as famously declared by one of  his  spokespeople (The Washington Post has listed more than 2 000 false or misleading quotes from  him  in  his  first year in office)  taking media criticism from  Trump  is sort of like taking dating advice from Bill Cosby: Even if  its  good advice  the source has a credibility problem. âThe interest in  and importance of  these awards â  he  said  âis far greater than anyone could have anticipated!""
But when the event came up  it was remarkably low-key for the famously flamboyant and larger-than-life  Trump . No Oscar-worthy red carpets  limos or Hollywood reporters asking what people were wearing.
Instead there was a tweet from  Trump  with a link to the Republican Partyâs gop.com website  which immediately crashed under the sudden spike in demand. Some wags have found some symbolism in that  as though the Grand Old Party still isnât ready for the arrival of  Trump  and  his  loyal new tribe of the Trumpicons.
Ready or not  it soon became apparent why  Trump  had gone low-key with  his  list. As a list of abuses of truth or the public trust  it flops. Thatâs because most major media have this habit of correcting errors as soon as possible.  Trump  has a habit  cultivated long before  he  became president  of almost never apologizing for or even admitting to making a mistake.
Itâs easy to see why  Trump  would want to remind everybody that the stock market has surged  contrary to Krugmanâs doomsday prediction. But  as The Washington Postâs Fact Checker pointed out  Krugman retracted that prediction three days later  noting that âit is possible that bigger budget deficits will  if anything  strengthen the economy briefly.â","By the time he got around to presenting his long-promised â2017 Fake New Awards â  [TGT]  seemed to be losing interest in the event.

But when the event came up  it was remarkably low-key for the famously flamboyant and larger-than-life  Trump . No Oscar-worthy red carpets  limos or Hollywood reporters asking what people were wearing.
Instead there was a tweet from  Trump  with a link to the Republican Partyâs gop.com website  which immediately crashed under the sudden spike in demand. Some wags have found some symbolism in that  as though the Grand Old Party still isnât ready for the arrival of  Trump  and  his  loyal new tribe of the Trumpicons.
Ready or not  it soon became apparent why  Trump  had gone low-key with  his  list. As a list of abuses of truth or the public trust  it flops. Thatâs because most major media have this habit of correcting errors as soon as possible.  Trump  has a habit  cultivated long before  he  became president  of almost never apologizing for or even admitting to making a mistake.
Itâs easy to see why  Trump  would want to remind everybody that the stock market has surged  contrary to Krugmanâs doomsday prediction. But  as The Washington Postâs Fact Checker pointed out  Krugman retracted that prediction three days later  noting that âit is possible that bigger budget deficits will  if anything  strengthen the economy briefly.â",Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,,,,,,
4913,On Trump: Make politics about government again,Donald Trump,"This was even more true for  candidate Donald Trump   whose most-discussed policy proposal â a border wall  to be paid for by Mexico â was widely acknowledged as more about symbolism than border control.

4917,White House considering offer from mega,Trump,"WASHINGTON â  The Trump administration  is considering an offer from Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson to pay for at least part of a new US embassy in Jerusalem  four US officials told the Associated Press.
In one possible scenario   the administration  would solicit contributions not only from Adelson but potentially from other donors in the evangelical and American Jewish communities  too. One official said Adelson  a Las Vegas casino magnate and staunch supporter of Israel  had offered to pay the difference between the total cost â expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars â and what  the administration  is able to raise.
Under any circumstance  letting private citizens cover the costs of an official government building would mark a significant departure from historical US practice. In the Jerusalem case  it would add yet another layer of controversy to  President Trumpâs  politically charged decision to move the embassy  given  Adelsonâs  longstanding affiliation with right-wing Israeli politics.
Itâs not clear if there are any precedents  nor whether government lawyers would give the green light to accept  Adelsonâs  or anyone else âs  donations for the embassy.
Adelson âs  unconventional offer was made around the time  Trump  announced in December  he  would move the embassy to the disputed city of Jerusalem. It would address the presidentâs stated distaste for shelling out eye-popping sums for overseas diplomatic facilities. Although  Trump  has promoted the Jerusalem move as fulfilling a key campaign promise   he  also was outspoken last month in blasting the $1 billion price tag for a new embassy in London.
Since  Trumpâs  announcement   his  administration has been sifting through options for fast-tracking the Israel embassyâs relocation. Last month  Vice President Mike Pence announced during a visit to Israel that the embassy would move by the end of 2019 â possibly earlier. Ambassador David Friedman  who lobbied for  Trumpâs  decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israelâs capital  has advocated moving the embassy as soon as possible.

 Adelson  who donated $5 million to Trumpâs inaugural committee   is one of the Republican Partyâs biggest donors and a major supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Adelson  also finances Israel Hayom  a pro-Netanyahu newspaper that is distributed free throughout Israel.
If lawyers decide to allow donations for the Jerusalem embassy  it wouldnât be without significant political risk for  Trump .  The president  already faces major criticism from Palestinians and others who say  his  decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem â also claimed by the Palestinians for the capital of their future state â tipped the scaled unfairly in Israelâs favor.
Mort Klein  president of the pro-Israel group Zionist Organization of America and a close associate of  Adelson   said accepting donations would be ill-advised. Klein said he knew  Adelson  was âdeeply interestedâ in seeing the embassy relocate to Jerusalem but was unaware that the casino mogul had offered to help pay for it himself.","WASHINGTON â   [TGT] is considering an offer from Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson to pay for at least part of a new US embassy in Jerusalem  four US officials told the Associated Press.

 Trump  made reviving the coal industry  and the declining communities that depend upon  its  jobs  a central tenet in  his  presidential campaign and has rolled back Obama-era environmental regulations to give the industry a boost.

4921,Redefining the Wall: What Donald Trump 's 'Great Wall' Looks like After Eight Months of Presidency,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump  has promised supporters a âGreat Wallâ on the southern border since the day  he  announced  his  presidential campaign.
 He  promised  âI would build a great wall  and nobody builds walls better than me  believe me  and Iâll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great  great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.â
Today  how does the  Trump  administration define the wall?
Yes   Trump  will build âa wall â administration officials said  and  he  is still committed to securing the southern border  but after eight months of  his  presidency  supporters have no idea what the actual wall will look like.
â President Trump  campaigned on and will deliver  his  promise to the American people to build a wall and gain control of our southern border â a senior administration official told Breitbart News.
Shortly after taking office   Trump  signed an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to âtake steps to immediately plan  design  and construct a physical wall along the southern border.â
On Tuesday  the Customs and Border Patrol released a video of a backhoe digging near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in San Diego  California  with the announcement that construction of the prototypes had begun â eight months after  Trump  signed  his  executive order.
âYou know  we have a wall up there now  and weâre renovating it already â  Trump  said  explaining that  his  administration was making it âpristineâ and âperfect.â
 He  confessed that after  his  conversations with border officials  a âsee-throughâ wall was necessary for border security.
âFrankly  I didnât know it until about a year ago â  he  said  admitting that the âpre-cast concrete wallâ  he  previously proposed would not be good enough to stop drugs.
 Trump  said that drug cartels were already using catapults to throw drugs over existing walls  where it could hit unsuspecting border patrol agents.
âI think also I have to be honest with you: a see-through wall would look better â  he  added.
 He  explained that the United States did not need to build a wall on a river or over a mountain  as they were natural barriers to prevent border crossings.
 Trump  highlighted that construction of the wall prototypes started Tuesday and are âjust about completed â promising supporters that  he  will be personally involved in the selection process.
âIâm going to go out and look at them personally. Iâm going to pick the right one â  he  said. âWeâre renovating the existing wall  and we are going to have as much wall as we need. â¦ Weâre going to build the wall.

Yes    [TGT] will build âa wall â administration officials said  and   [TGT]   is still committed to securing the southern border  but after eight months of   [TGT]   presidency  supporters have no idea what the actual wall will look like.
 [TGT] campaigned on and will deliver   [TGT]   promise to the American people to build a wall and gain control of our southern border â a senior administration official told Breitbart News.
Shortly after taking office    [TGT]   signed an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to âtake steps to immediately plan  design  and construct a physical wall along the southern border.â
On Tuesday  the Customs and Border Patrol released a video of a backhoe digging near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in San Diego  California  with the announcement that construction of the prototypes had begun â eight months after   [TGT]   signed   [TGT]   executive order.
âYou know  we have a wall up there now  and weâre renovating  [TGT]  already â   [TGT] said  explaining that   [TGT]   administration was making it âpristineâ and âperfect.â
  [TGT]   confessed that after   [TGT]   conversations with border officials  a âsee-throughâ wall was necessary for border security.
âFrankly  I didnât know it until about a year ago â  he  said  admitting that the âpre-cast concrete wallâ  he  previously proposed would not be good enough to stop drugs.
  [TGT] said that drug cartels were already using catapults to throw drugs over existing walls  where  [TGT]  could hit unsuspecting border patrol agents.
âI think also I have to be honest with you: a see-through wall would look better â   [TGT]   added.
  [TGT]   explained that the United States did not need to build a wall on a river or over a mountain  as they were natural barriers to prevent border crossings.
  [TGT] highlighted that construction of the wall prototypes started Tuesday and are âjust about completed â promising supporters that   [TGT]   will be personally involved in the selection process.
âIâm going to go out and look at them personally. Iâm going to pick the right one â   [TGT]   said. âWeâre renovating the existing wall  and we are going to have as much wall as we need. â¦ Weâre going to build the wall. Itâs coming along great.â",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,

4924,Atlanta hasn't forgotten Trump called it 'crime infested',Trump,"(CNN) When  President Trump  visits Atlanta Monday night to attend college football's national championship game    he  may not remember just a year ago  he  described  the city  as ""in horrible shape "" ""falling apart"" and ""crime infested.""
 Trump 's disparaging comments about Atlanta came about a week before  his  inauguration last year  as part of a tweet attack that targeted civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis.
""Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district  which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk  talk  talk - no action or results. Sad ""  Trump  tweeted.
The congressman was on the receiving end of  Trump 's ire after Lewis said  Trump  wasn't a ""legitimate"" president because of Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Lewis also skipped  Trump 's inauguration.
To many   Trump 's tweets were even more jarring because he took on an icon of the civil rights movement during the holiday weekend celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth.

4925,Most Americans considered Trumpâs âshitholeâ comments racist,Trump,"President Trump speaks to reporters after the Congressional Republican Leadership retreat at Camp David  Md.  on Jan. 6. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)
During an Oval Office meeting with senators from both parties last week   a frustrated President Trump  lashed out at the idea of allowing immigrants from poorer countries to enter the United States.
âWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?â  he  asked about Haiti  African nations and El Salvador  according to people in the room. The Washington Postâs reporting on his comment immediately began days of analysis of what he might have meant  if he actually used a different word (such as âshithouseâ) and  naturally  what he might have meant by that word  if he used it.
The question also started another line of questioning that unfolded on Google. On the afternoon of Jan. 11  after The Post report  searches for âis  Trump  racistâ spiked in the United States.
In the case of Trumpâs comments about the mostly nonwhite countries from which he wanted to curtail immigration (unlike the mostly white country of Norway)  we have a new poll from Quinnipiac University that tells us just how likely Americans were to consider them racist.
Nearly 6 in 10 Americans think that Trumpâs comments were racist. That includes majorities of independents and nearly all Democrats. It includes just over half of whites  7 in 10 Hispanics and nearly 9 in 10 black Americans. White men  Republicans and white people without college degrees were more likely to say that the comments werenât racist.
Which makes sense. After all  the groups that said Trumpâs comments were racist were also mostly the same people that told Quinnipiac that he doesnât respect people of color as much as he respects white people.
When I say they were âmostlyâ the same people  thatâs an understatement. Ninety-three percent of those who said  Trump  doesnât respect people of color as much as  he  does whites also said the comments were racist; 82 percent of those who think  Trump  does respect people of color said that the comments werenât racist.
The overlap between views of Trumpâs comments and his broader views of race runs across demographic groups. The diagonal line below marks the place where views of Trumpâs comments and his general attitude toward people of color are equivalent. Each dot represents a demographic group. They are all tightly clustered around that diagonal line â meaning that the percentage of each group holding the view that  Trump  respects people of color less is about the same as the percent saying his comments were racist.
Quinnipiac asked the question about respect in December  too  and the patterns were similar â although the percentage of some groups that said  Trump  respected people of color less were slightly lower. This is probably a function of margins of error more than anything  although the fact that this most recent poll was conducted over a holiday weekend may have added some variability  as people may have been harder to reach.
What this suggests is that views of Trumpâs comments largely overlapped with peopleâs existing views of  Trump . Perhaps thatâs because those who viewed him as showing less respect to people of color also then were less charitable in their interpretation of his comments; perhaps itâs because the comments were hard to interpret in a more charitable way.
It also suggests that  barring  Trump  explicitly endorsing Nazism or white supremacy  interpretation of racially loaded comments by the president will continue to be seen through peopleâs existing lenses of his attitudes toward race.","President Trump speaks to reporters after the Congressional Republican Leadership retreat at Camp David  Md.  on Jan. 6.

4926,Trump frustrated by secrecy with JFK files,Donald Trump,"It was a showdown 25 years in the making: With the world itching to finally get a look at classified Kennedy assassination files  and the deadline for their release just hours away  intelligence officials were still angling for a way to keep their secrets.  President Donald Trump  the one man able to block the release   did not appreciate  their  persistence.  He  did not intend to make this easy.
Like much else surrounding investigations of the 1963 killing of President John F. Kennedy  Thursday's release of 2 800 records from the JFK files was anything but smooth. It came together only at the last minute  with White House lawyers still fielding late-arriving requests for additional redactions in the morning and an irritated  Trump  continuing to resist signing off on the request  according to an account by two White House officials. They spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.
The tale of the final hours before the congressionally mandated 25-year release deadline adds a new chapter to the story of  Trump 's troubled relationship with  his  spy agencies.  He  again flashed  his  skepticism and unpredictability in dealing with agencies long accustomed to a level of deference. Intelligence officials  meanwhile  were again left scratching their heads about a president whose impulses they cannot predict.
And those officials had their own story tell  some rejecting the notion they were slow to act on  Trump 's expectations for the documents. The CIA began work months ago to get its remaining assassination-related documents ready for release on Thursday  according to a person familiar with the process. The person  who was not authorized to publicly to discuss the process and spoke only on condition of anonymity  said the goal was to have all the agency's documents ready to be released in full or with national security redactions before the deadline.
Since taking office   Trump  has challenged the integrity of intelligence leaders  moved to exert more control over U.S. spying agencies and accused  his  predecessor of using government spycraft to monitor  his  campaign. In the JFK files matter  one White House official said   Trump  wanted to make clear he wouldn't be bullied by the agencies.
Whatever occurred in the lead-up to deadline day   Trump  was irritated Thursday that agencies still were arguing for more redactions.  The president  earlier in the week had tweeted to tease the release of the documents  heightening the sense of drama on a subject that has sparked the imaginations of conspiracy theorists for decades. Under a 1992 law  all of the records related to the assassination were to be made public unless explicitly withheld by  the president .
Just before the release Thursday   Trump  wrote in a memorandum that  he  had ""no choice"" but to agree to requests from the CIA and FBI to keep thousands of documents secret because of the possibility that releasing the information could still harm national security. Two aides said  Trump  was upset by what  he  perceived to be overly broad secrecy requests  adding that the agencies had been explicitly warned about  his  expectation that redactions be kept to a minimum.
Late last week   Trump  received his first official briefing on the release in an Oval Office meeting that included Chief of Staff John Kelly  White House Counsel Don McGahn and National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg.  Trump  made it clear  he  was unsatisfied with the pace of declassification.
 Trump 's tweets  an official said  were meant as a signal to the intelligence community to take seriously  his  threats to release the documents in their entirety.
According to White House officials   Trump  accepted that some of the records contained references to sensitive sources and methods used by the intelligence community and law enforcement and that declassification could harm American foreign policy interests. But after having the scope of the redactions presented to him   Trump  told aides  he  did not believe them to be in the spirit of the law.
On Thursday   Trump 's top aides presented  him  with an alternative to simply acquiescing to the agency requests:  He  could temporarily allow the redactions while ordering the agencies to launch a new comprehensive examination of the records still withheld or redacted in part.  Trump  accepted the suggestion  ordering that agencies be ""extremely circumspect"" about keeping the remaining documents secret at the end of the 180-day assessment.
""After strict consultation with General Kelly  the CIA and other agencies  I will be releasing ALL JFK files other than the names and addresses of any mentioned person who is still living  "" Trump  wrote in a Friday tweet.

4927,Is War With Iran Or North Korea Inevitable?,Trump,"In his Tuesday  October 17  2017 column our old friend Pat Buchanan asked the question  in light of President Trumpâs decision not to certify that the Islamic Republic of Iran is in compliance with their nuclear weapons deal with Obama  is war with Iran now inevitable?
As  President Trump  weighs the appropriate response to the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran  Democrats have  for their own political purposes  made  President Trump  out to be a warmonger in much the same way that they tried to make Ronald Reagan out to be a warmonger who was pushing the world toward nuclear destruction when he refused to accept Soviet nuclear superiority.
Today  we see narratives similar to the one used against Reagan being developed and used against  President Trump ; for example  an October 16  2017 op-ed in The Washington Post by New York University Professor Steven J. Brams advocated a âNo First Useâ of nuclear weapons declaration by the United States as way of defusing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
Even though much of the pushback against Reagan turned out to be Soviet-inspired propaganda and information warfare  the image of Reagan as a warmonger stuck in the minds of the Left-leaning media and it has been all too easy to transfer the idea and apply it to  Donald Trump .
This is very much the situation before  President Trump  today as  he  considers  his  options with regard to North Korea and Iran: Is it better to be safe than sorry? Should we strike now or in the near future in order to prevent a predicted (actually known in the case of both North Korea and Iran) enemy from obtaining nuclear weapons and changing the balance of power or otherwise behaving in a manner that we would judge to be intolerable.
The question for  President Trump  is at what point do the other options available to stop the threat be judged failures and the tipping point of our tolerance be judged to have been reached?
President Trumpâs statements implying that both Iran and North Korea are fast reaching the tipping point where preemption would be justified do not make him a warmonger  rather they mean that  Donald Trump  has come down on the side of Reagan and Goldwater and embraced the United Statesâ global role as the principal guardian of world order  and that  he  has concluded that role requires America to maintain the capability to behave preventively  and to be willing to use it.","In his Tuesday  October 17  2017 column our old friend Pat Buchanan asked the question  in light of President Trumpâs decision not to certify that the Islamic Republic of Iran is in compliance with their nuclear weapons deal with Obama  is war with Iran now inevitable?
As   [TGT] weighs the appropriate response to the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran  Democrats have  for their own political purposes  made   [TGT] out to be a warmonger in much the same way that they tried to make Ronald Reagan out to be a warmonger who was pushing the world toward nuclear destruction when he refused to accept Soviet nuclear superiority.
Today  we see narratives similar to the one used against Reagan being developed and used against  [TGT]  ; for example  an October 16  2017 op-ed in The Washington Post by New York University Professor Steven J. Brams advocated a âNo First Useâ of nuclear weapons declaration by the United States as way of defusing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
Even though much of the pushback against Reagan turned out to be Soviet-inspired propaganda and information warfare  the image of Reagan as a warmonger stuck in the minds of the Left-leaning media and it has been all too easy to transfer the idea and apply it to  [TGT]  .
This is very much the situation before  [TGT] today as   [TGT]   considers   [TGT]   options with regard to North Korea and Iran: Is it better to be safe than sorry? Should we strike now or in the near future in order to prevent a predicted (actually known in the case of both North Korea and Iran) enemy from obtaining nuclear weapons and changing the balance of power or otherwise behaving in a manner that we would judge to be intolerable.

4928,Gas Tax Increase Would Hit Trump States Hardest Koch Groups Say,Donald Trump,"A federal gas tax increase to help pay for upgrading U.S. roads and bridges would fall hardest on states won by  Donald Trump  in 2016  according to a report released Tuesday by two groups tied to the billionaire Koch brothers and opposed to increasing the levy.
The impact of raising the gas tax by 25 cents per gallon  as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has suggested and  Trump  reportedly has offered to support  would vary widely from state to state because of differences in the current tax rate and fuel consumption  the report by Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners shows. Of the top 10 states identified by the groups as facing the highest percentage increase in total gas tax liability   Trump  won nine.
Opposition to the tax increase proposal also potentially puts the Koch affiliated groups in conflict with  Trump   who previously has said heâs open to raising the levy and last week unveiled a long-awaited plan to generate at least $1.5 trillion in new infrastructure spending.
In raw dollars  the report found that Mississippi would face the largest increase in annual new gas tax burden per household ($391)  followed by Wyoming ($380) and South Carolina ($377).  Trump  won all three.
The report doesnât specifically identify the hardest-hit states as having been won by  Trump . But their findings illustrate the impact of a gas tax increase on areas where the president dominated in the 2016 vote.
These are the states facing largest potential percentage increase over current gas tax proposal. Those with the lowest state taxes would see the largest bump because theyâre starting from a smaller base. The only state among the top 10 that  Trump  didnât win is New Mexico.","A federal gas tax increase to help pay for upgrading U.S. roads and bridges would fall hardest on states won by   [TGT] in 2016  according to a report released Tuesday by two groups tied to the billionaire Koch brothers and opposed to increasing the levy.

In a damning speech on Wednesday   Trump  called the isolated communist country ""a hell that no person deserves.""
One woman CNN spoke to on the streets of Pyongyang called  Trump 's assertion ""foolish "" ""absurd"" and another word CNN cannot print.
North Korean state media reported that  Trump  had spoken on Thursday  but did not include concrete details of  his  speech  in which the President slammed Pyongyang's human rights abuses.
The North Korean state newspaper Rodong Sinmun characterized  Trump 's words as ""garbage spewing like gunpowder out of  Trump 's snout like garbage that reeks of gun powder to ignite war.""
CNN's government minders allowed us to reveal the actual contents of what  Trump  said to citizens on the streets of Pyongyang  agreeing to take us down to a busy street corner and interview citizens.
"" Trump  has no right to talk about human rights "" Ri said  as the government minders translated for her. "" He 's a simple war maniac.""
The phrase ""maniac"" is one that North Korean state media often uses to describe  Trump   and that's no coincidence.
Ri Won Gil  an editor at a publishing company (unrelated and unacquainted to Ri Yong Hui)  also called  Trump  a maniac.
Ri told CNN  Trump  was ""a fool  a maniac and the only response to what he is saying is to give him a good beating with a stick.""
""( Trump ) knows nothing at all about North Korea and in general about the Korean nation "" Ri said. ""He has no common sense or knowledge about what we are. He may have said some things  but we don't really care. We have our own national economy which was carved out and developed by the previous leaders and is being continuously built by the current leader.""
Ri Won Gil  an editor  told CNN  Trump  ""knows nothing"" about life in North Korea.
 Trump  is currently in Beijing as part of a nearly two-week long tour of Asia  and North Korea's nuclear and weapons program have been a top priority  he 's discussed with  his  Japanese  South Korean and Chinese counterparts.

4931,Democrats call for largest IRS budget to improve service as Trump calls for cuts,Trump,"If  President Trump  is such a good dealmaker  why is  he  proposing to cut $239 million from the moneymaking but ailing Internal Revenue Service?
Does  this businessman  know the IRS provides excellent returns on investment? For every dollar the agency spends  it collects $4. Its enforcement activities do even better: $1 returns $6.
Yet  if  Trumpâs  spending plan takes effect  the general trend of punitive IRS budgets at the hands of a Republican-dominated Congress will be exacerbated  much to the detriment of fed-up taxpayers and frustrated employees.
 Trumpâs  proposed $239 million decrease isnât much in comparison  but  it  comes on top of years of cuts. The high point  $12.1 billion  was in 2010.
âAn increase in funding for the IRS will reverse the short-sighted and damaging budget cuts which have increased our national debt  left the IRS ill-equipped to combat refund errors and fraud  drastically reduced taxpayer services  dangerously reduced audits  and limits the IRS âs  ability to implement new laws passed by Congress â said the letter led by Rep.

 The ban  applies to people from Syria  Chad  Iran  Libya  Somalia and Yemen.
The nine-member high court said in two one-page orders late Monday afternoon that lower court rulings that partly blocked  the ban  should be put on hold while appeals courts in Richmond  Va.  and San Francisco take up the case.
The justices offered no explanation for their order  but the administration had said that blocking  the full ban  was causing ""irreparable harm"" because the policy is based on legitimate national security and foreign policy concerns.
White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley called  the ban  âlawful and essential to protecting our homeland.â
 Trumpâs travel ban  has been challenged in separate lawsuits by Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union. Both have argued  the ban  discriminates against Muslims and should not go into effect under immigration laws.
 ""President Trumpâs anti-Muslim prejudice  is no secret â  he  has repeatedly confirmed  it   including just last week on Twitter "" Omar Jadwat  director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project  said in a statement.

In the debate over which and how many immigrants to welcome into the United States  the White House has set up a clear contrast between immigrants with âmeritâ and those with family connections. The first category incorporates âpeople who are skilled  who want to work  who will contribute to our society  and who will love and respect our country â as  President Trump  laid out in  his  State of the Union address. The second category  the administration claims  encompasses low-skilled workers who put downward pressure on wages and increase the budget deficit while fueling gang violence and terrorism.
Framed that way  it seems obvious that the United States should curtail what  Trump  calls âchain migration â in which U.S. citizens and green-card holders can sponsor family members living abroad to come here  too. Indeed  when the Harvard-Harris Poll asked registered voters last month  âDo you think immigration priority for those coming to the U.S. should be based on a personâs ability to contribute to America as measured by their education and skills or based on a person having relatives in the U.S.?â nearly 80 percent chose skills and education over blood.
One problem stems from how the administration defines skills.  Trump  wants more immigrants with advanced degrees who have high-paying jobs lined up for them. Those are good things  and  he âs right to prioritize them.
Much of the argument around brains vs. blood seems based on the assumption that we have too many immigrants and must drastically reduce the number. After all   Trumpâs proposal  doesnât include additional visas for merit but rather a reshuffling of the current ones.  It âs true that immigration is higher than itâs been in decades. Immigrants represent about 13.5 percent of the population  up from about 5 percent in 1970  and close to the rates of the 1920s. The annual growth rate in the foreign-born population is just over 2 percent.","[TGT] made a case against what   [TGT]   calls âchain migrationâ during   [TGT]   State of the Union address.

4940,Who understands Trumpism better: Trump or Bannon?,Trump,"The split between President Trump and former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon over the U.S. Senate race in Alabama should be easy enough to explain. Even friends with similar views disagree sometimes  right?
That is not Bannon's explanation  however. Appearing on Sean Hannity's Fox News show Monday night  the Breitbart News chairman suggested that he understands  Trumpism  better than  Trump  himself â that he is supporting Republican challenger Roy Moore instead of the president's candidate  incumbent Sen. Luther Strange  because Moore is actually the ally  Trump  needs  whether he realizes it or not.
[Stephen K. Bannonâs remarkable admission:  President Trump  is easily duped]
âWhat I'm here to do is to support  Donald J. Trump  by having folks down here support Judge Roy Moore â Bannon told Hannity after speaking at a rally for Moore in Fairhope  Ala.  on the eve of a GOP primary runoff. âI think Roy Moore is the guy that's going to represent  Donald Trump  and fight the establishment.â
âWe're not here to defy  President Trump  â Bannon added a moment later. âWe were here to praise and honor  him . And we think the best way to do that is to send somebody to Washington  D.C.  out of Alabama â the good folks of Alabama to send somebody that's going to have  Donald Trump 's back.â
Bannon made those remarks three days after  Trump  spoke at a rally for Strange.  Trump 's position is that Strange is the guy who will have his back. Yet here is Bannon  claiming that  Trump  doesn't know what is best for  himself .
Here's the truly zany thing:  Trump  seems to think that Bannon might be right.
âI'll be honest: I might have made a mistake â  Trump  said at Strange's rally on Friday  in one of those off-script moments that characterize  his  stump speeches.
âAnd I told Luther â  Trump  continued  âI have to say this: If his opponent wins  I'm going to be here campaigning like hell for him.â
[As  Trump  campaigns for Strange in Alabama   he  expresses some doubts: âI might have made a mistakeâ]
Bannon is hardly alone among  Trump  supporters in backing Moore  and the president appears to be considering the possibility that his base really did do a better job of picking the most Trump-like candidate than he did. My Fix colleague  Amber Phillips  framed the runoff like this:
An establishment candidate is running for his political life against a controversial  say-anything figure whom the elites despise. And against all political logic  the establishment may very well lose. It's as if the 2016 presidential campaign is playing out in the Alabama Senate Republican primary to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Only this time   President Trump  is on the establishment side  and Alabama voters could very well go against the president they adore.
The troubling development  for  Trump   is that some of  his  backers are willing to divorce Trumpism from  Trump himself . They cling more tightly to what  he  symbolized during  his  insurgent campaign for the White House than they cling to  him  â to the point of ignoring  his  endorsement.
Earlier this month  Ann Coulter  who wrote a book called âIn  Trump  We Trust â was asked in an interview on WBAL radio in Baltimore whether she still trusts in  Trump .
âUm  I trust in Trumpism â Coulter replied.
 Trump  is now in a fight with Bannon and company to define  his  own political brand.

4941,Trump predicted a 'crisis' if a president faced an investigation,Trump,"Richard Nixon was first  and he was forced to resign in disgrace. Bill Clinton was second  and he was impeached. And  Donald Trump  is third  though his fate remains to be seen.
For quite a while   Trump  grudgingly conceded that the investigation into the Russia scandal was ongoing  but  he  went to great lengths to insist that  he   as president  wasnât personally under investigation â to the point that  he  leaned on a variety of officials  including former FBI Director James Comey  to publicly declare to the nation that the president wasnât the focus of any probe.

THE LEAD STORY - 'HANNITY' EXCLUSIVE - 'MISSING' FBI TEXTS FOUND?: The Justice Department has started recovering some of the missing texts between two FBI officials under scrutiny for alleged anti-Trump views  Fox News' Sean Hannity reported on Wednesday's ""Hannity "" citing DOJ sources ... 50 000 missing text messages between FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page over a five-month period have been at the center of controversy on Capitol Hill since the DOJ notified congressional committees that there was a gap in records between Dec. 14  2016  and May 17  2017. Strzok and Page - and the integrity of the FBI - have been under the microscope after it was revealed that the two former members of Robert Mueller's team exchanged a series of anti-Trump texts during the presidential campaign.
'THERE'S NO COLLUSION ... THERE'S NO OBSTRUCTION  WHATSOEVER':  President Trump  said Wednesday  he 's ""looking forward"" to answering questions under oath in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation on alleged Russia collusion in the 2016 presidential election. However  it remained unclear whether  the president  would agree to an interview by Mueller's team ... Meanwhile  more than 20 White House personnel have voluntarily given interviews to Mueller's investigators  Fox News has learned exclusively. A personal attorney for  President Donald Trump  also said the White House turned over more than 20 000 pages of records to investigators  calling the level of cooperation and transparency ""unprecedented.""
'AMERICA FIRST' DOESN'T MEAN 'AMERICA ALONE':  President Trump  is ready to play salesman at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  making the case that  his  ""America First"" agenda can go hand-in-hand with global cooperation ...  Trump  is set to arrive in Davos on Thursday to declare that the United States is open for business.

4946,Rep. Dana Rohrabacher: Republican Leadership âToo Timidâ in Probing Democratsâ Russia Scandals,Trump,"Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) said Wednesday that the Republican Party leadership has been âtoo timidâ in dealing with the various Russia-related controversies plaguing the Democrats  and said he believes it is because the leadership is âuncomfortableâ with  President Trump .
Additionally  he called for probes into recent revelations that Hillary Clintonâs campaign funded the â Trump  dossierâ put together by Fusion GPS â a company that is alleged to have ties to the Kremlin.
âWe need to have a serious set of hearings open to the public so the public will be able to see whatâs going on â he said. âI will tell you that the Republican Party has been too timid about this and I believe thatâs because some of our leaders feel uncomfortable with  Donald Trump  and they were supporting other candidates during the primary process.â
Rohrabacher noted that  he  supported Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)  not  Trump   during the primaries. However   he  said it was important that Democrats  as well as Republicans  recognize that  Trump  won the election fairly:
The American people have spoken   the election of Donald Trump  was not a collusion with Russians and a stealing of the election  it was an honest reflection of the voters of this country and our system and the fact that the Democrats continued to shove this lie down our throat every day constantly for months  that: âOh  this election  was stolen by  Trump  collusion with Russia â that was a disservice.

 President Trump  last June sought to fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III but backed off after White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn threatened to resign. (Bastien Inzaurralde Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post)
 President Trump  sought the firing of Robert S. Mueller III last June  shortly after the special counsel took over the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election  and  he  backed off only after White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn threatened to resign over the move.
McGahn did not deliver his resignation threat directly to  Trump   but was serious about his threat to leave  according to a person familiar with the episode.
 The presidentâs  effort came in the weeks after Muellerâs appointment last May to lead the probe into whether Trumpâs campaign coordinated with Russian attempts to tilt the election. Mueller was tapped for the role by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein after  Trump  fired FBI Director James B. Comey.
The special counsel probe has quickly expanded to include an exploration of whether  Trump  has attempted to obstruct the ongoing investigation â a line of inquiry that could now include the presidentâs threatens to fire Mueller himself.
 President Trump  told reporters on Jan. 24 that  he  is âlooking forwardâ to speaking to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.  Trump  said there was âno collusionâ between  his  presidential campaign and Russia. (David Nakamura/The Washington Post)
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)  a former state attorney general  described Trumpâs attempt to oust Mueller as âremarkable and stunning â adding in an interview  âit shows the need immediately to protect the special counsel.â
 Trump  was initially calm when Mueller was appointed  surprising White House aides  according to a senior administration official.
But in the weeks that followed   the president  spoke with a number of friends and advisers who convinced  him  that Mueller would dig through  his  private finances and look beyond questions of collusion with Russians. They warned that the probe could last years and would ruin  his  first term in office.
At the time   Trumpâs  legal team was urging  him  to take an aggressive posture toward the special counsel and was compiling arguments about why Mueller could not be impartial. Among the points cited: an allegation that Mueller had gotten into a dispute over membership fees before he resigned from a Trump-owned golf course in Northern Virginia in 2011.
[Trump team seeks to control  block Muellerâs Russia investigation]
 Trumpâs  ire at Mueller rose to such a level that then-White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon and then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus grew âincredibly concernedâ that he was going to fire Mueller and sought to enlist others to intervene with the president  according to a  Trump  adviser who requested anonymity to describe private conversations.
In one meeting with other advisers  Bannon raised the concern that if  Trump  fired Mueller it could trigger a challenge to his presidency based on the 25th Amendment  which lays out the process of who would succeed a president in case of incapacitation.
Despite internal objections   Trump  decided to assert that Mueller had unacceptable conflicts of interest and moved to remove him from his position  according to the people familiar with the discussions.
In response  McGahn said he would not remain at the White House if  Trump  went through with the move  according to a senior administration official.","[TGT]  sought to fire special counsel Robert S.

He 's worth maybe four or five hundred million dollars  and  he 's standing at Le Cirque or one of them and  he  couldn't get a table.
""So I see  him  standing there and  he 's a little embarrassed and  he  says  'Don  could you help me get a table?' So I got  him  a table. So  he  calls the next day and I said  'No one knows you  you're very successful ' And  he  says  'No  no no  I like to keep a low profile.'

""If it is not the impossible   Donald  is simply not interested "" one of  his  vice presidents has said.
He recently brought a $500 million libel suit against the Chicago Tribune and the paper's architecture critic  Paul Gapp  charging that the critic ""virtually torpedoed""  Trump 's latest real estate idea  a plan for the world's ""tallest"" building.

""  [TGT]  's one of the most successful men in New York  and   [TGT]   couldn't get a table at a restaurant.

""So I see   [TGT]   standing there and   [TGT]  's a little embarrassed and   [TGT]   says  'Don  could you help me get a table?' So I got   [TGT]   a table.

4953,Trump urged by some to go on the attack against Mueller,Donald Trump,"Even as President Donald Trump's advisers encourage him to accept the realities of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe  longtime friends and allies are pushing  Trump  to fight back  citing concerns that  his  lawyers are naive to the existential threat facing the president.
 Trump  supporters and associates inside and outside the White House see the conciliatory path as risky to the maverick president's tenure. Instead  they want the street-fighting tweeter to criticize Mueller with abandon.
The struggle between supporters of the legal team's steady  cooperative approach  and the band of  Trump  loyalists who yearn for a fight  comes as the Mueller probe begins lapping at the door of the Oval Office. Mueller  who is investigating the firing of former FBI director James Comey and other key actions of the  Trump  administration  has signaled that his team intends to interview multiple current and former White House officials in the coming weeks and has requested large batches of documents from the executive branch.
In private   Trump  remains relatively calm for now  but that doesn't mean he thinks the Russia probe is legitimate  and he could return to fighting Mueller at any moment  according to a group of about 15  Trump  allies  advisers and former campaign aides  who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly about private conversations with the White House.
The president still periodically flashes his anger  blasting the Senate intelligence committee's investigation in a tweet last Thursday and urging them to investigate journalists instead of his campaign and family. And in a private dinner with social conservatives last month   Trump  expressed frustration over Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal  which helped pave the road to Mueller's appointment.
""The president respects what Bob Mueller is doing and has fully cooperated and asked everyone around him to fully cooperate with Bob "" said  Trump 's attorney  John Dowd. ""And as a result "" he added  there has been for months ""a very productive  professional relationship.""
Ty Cobb  the White House lawyer responsible for responding to Mueller's information requests  said it's important to  Trump  ""and the country to get this behind us.""
But the question of cooperation is far from settled for  Trump 's allies  many of whom are pressing  him  to fight Mueller more aggressively.
That tension was apparent at a private dinner of close to a dozen conservative leaders with  Trump  and  his  top aides on Sept. 25  though accounts of the gathering vary.
In one version  one guest peppered  Trump  with questions about what  he  was going to do about the special counsel's investigation. While  Trump  was dismissive   the president  said  he  was keeping  his  head low and such questions should be posed to Sessions himself  according to two people who were present and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private dinner.
But a third person in the room said that  Trump  was visibly angry with Sessions and made a flippant remark about the attorney general's decision to recuse himself from overseeing the federal Russia probe.
One former  Trump  campaign aide in contact with  the president  said  Trump 's feelings about Sessions have evolved in the last few months.  Trump  believes Sessions hurt  him  by not disclosing  his  interactions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the vetting process for attorney general.
Sessions should have been upfront with  Trump  and alerted  him  to those encounters rather than waiting for word of them to become public  the former campaign aide said. But  the president 's anger with Sessions also has diminished greatly in recent months  the same aide noted.
Supporters of  Trump 's legal team and the discipline imposed by Chief of Staff John Kelly are hoping that  Trump  will remain even-keeled and not jeopardize  himself  with public outbursts. They consider Mueller's appointment the product of the most serious of self-inflicted wounds â  Trump 's firing of Comey â but are confident  Trump  will survive the investigation.
But others  including many who worked closely with  Trump  on  his  successful election campaign  don't trust Mueller and believe White House lawyers are foolhardy to cooperate when  the president  is at risk.
The president and  his  team need to understand that this is a ""political brawl"" â not just a legal fight â and take that fight to Mueller  said the former campaign aide  who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private discussions with the president and  his  team.","Even as  [TGT]  encourage  [TGT]  to accept the realities of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe  longtime friends and allies are pushing  Trump  to fight back  citing concerns that   [TGT]   lawyers are naive to the existential threat facing the president.

4956,GOP memo puts spotlight back on Trump campaign controversy,Donald Trump,"Close video  Trump  faith misplaced in memo reportedly focused on Carter Page Rachel Maddow notes reporting that the subject of the Nunes memo is Carter Page  who has a long history with U.S. intelligence and Russia and unfortunately for  Trump  is not a sympathetic figure for abuse of surveillance. share tweet email save Embed
Though the public hasnât yet seen the Nunes memo  by all accounts  much of its focus is on federal surveillance of Carter Page  one of only a handful of people  Donald Trump  identified as a foreign policy adviser to  his  2016 presidential campaign. This Carter Page.
 Carter Page  who served as a foreign-policy adviser to Donald Trumpâs campaign   was known to U.S. counterintelligence officials for years before  he  became a prominent figure in a dossier of unverified research about the future presidentâs ties to Russia. The White House is expected to release as early as this week a memo detailing what Republicans allege were surveillance abuses during the 2016 campaign. Republicans say the memo  written by the GOP staff on the House Intelligence Committee  shows that prosecutors used information gleaned from an ex-British spy â who was paid by a research firm hired by Democratic opponents of Mr. Trump â in their application for a secret court order to monitor  Mr. Page .
This may sound a little complicated  but itâs fairly straightforward: U.S. intelligence officials were keeping an eye on  Page ; House Republicans have a memo that suggests  Page  shouldnât have faced scrutiny. Much of their argument is based on pushback against Christopher Steeleâs Fusion GPS dossier  which Republicans reject  despite the fact that none of its central claims have been discredited.
But even putting GOP hostility toward the dossier aside  itâs not altogether relevant â because the  Page  controversy predates the dossier by several years. In fact  as Rachel explained on the show last night   Page  was targeted by a Russian spy ring several years ago  drawing FBI scrutiny.
Six months after the spy ring was broken up  Page joined the  Trump  campaign as a foreign policy adviser. A few months later  Page  newly identified by  Trump  as someone who had the Republican candidateâs ear on matters related to international affairs  traveled to Russia  met with prominent officials  and denounced U.S. sanctions against the Putin government.
It was the sort of thing that was likely to capture the interest of U.S. counter-intelligence officials â and it did. Indeed  U.S. officials obtained a warrant to monitor  Page   arguing that there was probable cause to believe he was acting as an agent of a foreign power. It was around this time that U.S. intelligence agencies briefed top members of Congress about their concerns regarding  Page  during the presidential campaign.
Then  Trump  won the election  at which point   Page  went back to Moscow for another visit  during which time he again met with leading Russian officials.
And  it âs against this backdrop that leading congressional Republicans â including Devin Nunes and Paul Ryan â are effectively asking the public  âCan you believe  Carter Page  was under surveillance?â
To which the sensible answer should be  âYes. Thatâs very easy to believe. He was a suspected agent of a foreign adversary. In fact  the surveillance began before  Donald Trump  became a candidate.â
And yet  the Republican Party and its allies are heavily invested in the idea that surveillance of  Page  is not only controversial  but evidence of systemic wrongdoing in federal law enforcement. Itâs reportedly the key point in the GOP memo thatâs likely to be released today.
Perhaps Republicans havenât fully thought this through. For one thing  judge-approved surveillance of suspected agents of foreign powers isnât terribly controversial. But even putting that aside  what the Nunes memo is actually doing is reminding everyone â the public  the press  lawmakers  international observers of every stripe â that  Donald Trump âs presidential campaign brought on a suspected Russian agent as a foreign policy adviser for reasons no one in Trump World has explained.
None of this makes the Justice Department of the FBI look worse. It does  however  make  Donald Trumpâs  political operation look worse.","Close video  Trump  faith misplaced in memo reportedly focused on Carter Page Rachel Maddow notes reporting that the subject of the Nunes memo is Carter Page  who has a long history with U.S. intelligence and Russia and unfortunately for  Trump  is not a sympathetic figure for abuse of surveillance. share tweet email save Embed

4960,Trump offers support for limited effort on background checks,Donald Trump,"Interested in  Donald Trump ? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest  Donald Trump  news  video  and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
From the confines of his golf club  President Donald Trump offered support for a limited strengthening of federal background checks on gun purchases Monday while staying largely mum in the last few days about the victims of the Florida school massacre and the escalating debate about controls on weapons.
At his Florida club just 40 miles from a community ravaged by the shooting that left 17 dead last week   Trump  gave a nod toward a specific policy action  with the White House saying  he  had spoken Friday to Sen. John Cornyn  a Texas Republican  about a bipartisan bill designed to strengthen the FBI database of prohibited gun buyers.
The main action  Trump  has taken on guns in office has been to sign a resolution blocking an Obama-era rule designed to keep guns out of the hands of certain mentally disabled people. The president has voiced strong support for gun rights and the National Rifle Association.
Kristin Brown  co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  said the measure  Trump  discussed with Cornyn would help to enforce existing rules but would not close loopholes permitting loose private sales on the internet and at gun shows. She's pressing for a ban on assault-type weapons and for laws enabling family members  guardians or police to ask judges to strip gun rights temporarily from people who show warning signs of violence.
 Trump   who visited first responders and some victims Friday  has focused his comments on mental health  rather than guns. The White House says the president will host a ""listening session"" with students and teachers this week and will discuss school safety with state and local officials.

From the confines of his golf club  President Donald Trump offered support for a limited strengthening of federal background checks on gun purchases Monday while staying largely mum in the last few days about the victims of the Florida school massacre and the escalating debate about controls on weapons.
At his Florida club just 40 miles from a community ravaged by the shooting that left 17 dead last week    [TGT] gave a nod toward a specific policy action  with the White House saying  he  had spoken Friday to Sen. John Cornyn  a Texas Republican  about a bipartisan bill designed to strengthen the FBI database of prohibited gun buyers.
The main action   [TGT] has taken on guns in office has been to sign a resolution blocking an Obama-era rule designed to keep guns out of the hands of certain mentally disabled people.  [TGT]  has voiced strong support for gun rights and the National Rifle Association.
Kristin Brown  co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence  said the measure   [TGT] discussed with Cornyn would help to enforce existing rules but would not close loopholes permitting loose private sales on the internet and at gun shows.  [TGT] 's pressing for a ban on assault-type weapons and for laws enabling family members  guardians or police to ask judges to strip gun rights temporarily from people who show warning signs of violence.
  [TGT] who visited first responders and some victims Friday  has focused his comments on mental health  rather than guns. The White House says  [TGT]  will host a ""listening session"" with students and teachers this week and will discuss school safety with state and local officials. But they have offered no further details on who will attend those sessions.

A handful of U.S. companies are already promising to pay one-time bonuses to their employees and bump up hourly pay if  President Trump  signs into law the tax reform bill that has been voted on by the Republican-led Congress.

4963,Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos pleads guilty to lying about Russian contacts,Donald Trump,"George Papadopoulos  a former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump  pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to federal officials about his contacts with Russian nationals he believed had ties to the Russian government during Trump's presidential campaign.
Papadopoulos  who was named by  Trump  in March 2016 as a foreign policy adviser to the campaign  pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with the Russians when he was interviewed in January by federal agents who were investigating Russian interference in the presidential campaign.
The charge indicates that Mueller  who is known to be probing alleged coordination between the  Trump  campaign and the Kremlin  is deeply probing contacts with  Trump  campaign aides and Russian officials.
The court papers show that Papadopoulos had also met a Russian woman he believed had ties to the Kremlin and with whom he communicated about setting up a meeting between  Trump  campaign officials and Russian officials.
He told agents that he met the woman a year before joining the  Trump  campaign  but  in fact  he met her only after he was named to the campaign and communicated with her for months while working with  Trump  aides  the documents show.
Papadopoulos's plea agreement shows he was introduced to the woman by the professor  and she claimed she was a relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the plea  she told Papadopoulos she would like to help set up meetings for the  Trump  campaign with her associates to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under a future President Trump."," [TGT] pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to federal officials about  [TGT]  contacts with Russian nationals  [TGT]  believed had ties to the Russian government during Trump's presidential campaign.

4964,AP sources: Trump considers replacing Tillerson with Pompeo,Trump,"After months of clashes on policy and personality   President Donald Trump  is considering ousting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replacing  him  with hard-nosed CIA Director Mike Pompeo following less than a year on the job  senior U.S. officials said as turmoil within  Trump 's national security team burst into the open.
The White House plan  which  Trump  has not yet signed off on  would force a major realignment early in  his  term  also creating a vacancy atop the CIA that officials said could be filled by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas. The overhaul could produce a significant shift in both the tone and direction of  the president 's foreign policy  removing it from the understated former oil man whose style has never fit well with  Trump 's.
It is exceedingly rare for a secretary of state  America's face on the global stage  to be fired or to serve for a year or less. Nor is it common for presidents to have such a significant Cabinet revamp so soon after taking office. Too much churn could fuel the perception of chaos in the  Trump  White House â perhaps one reason he has yet to pull the trigger.
Tillerson's likely ouster  which was first reported by the New York Times  loomed awkwardly over an Oval Office meeting Thursday between  Trump  and the visiting Bahraini crown prince. Asked by a reporter whether he wanted Tillerson to stay on the job   Trump  was coy  merely pointing out that Tillerson was in fact in the building.
"" He 's here. Rex is here "" the president said.
After a report last month that Tillerson had called the president a ""moron "" Tillerson was forced to appear before cameras at the State Department to pledge fealty to his boss. Soon after   Trump  publicly challenged his secretary to an IQ match.
When Tillerson was tapped for the job late last year  many  Trump  critics expressed quiet relief that he'd picked a sober ""adult"" who could form a counterweight to the president's brasher  impulsive approach  especially on critical matters of war and peace.
Yet divisions on key foreign policy issues emerged quickly  and  Trump  has repeatedly undermined Tillerson by voicing positions at odds with those the State Department was pushing.
When Tillerson in June called on Arab nations to ease their blockade on Qatar   Trump  emerged in the Rose Garden hours later to lambaste Qatar for funding terrorism.  Trump  also deemed diplomacy with North Korea a waste of time  when Tillerson was pursuing just that. Tillerson's advice to  Trump  to stay in the Paris climate deal and certify Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal was similarly overruled.
Pompeo  in contrast  has formed a tight relationship with  Trump  that's led to a role much broader than many past CIA chiefs. A former businessman and conservative Republican congressman from Kansas  Pompeo is at the White House nearly every day to deliver the daily intelligence briefing  a task often delegated to less senior officials. He sometimes stays longer to accompany  Trump  to other meetings. He shares the president's hardline stance against Iran.
Cotton  a top contender to take over at CIA  has been one of  Trump 's staunchest defenders on foreign policy in Congress. Yet moving him would create a Senate vacancy just as Republicans need every vote possible. Under Arkansas law  if Cotton steps down before next July  the state's Republican governor would appoint a replacement who would serve until the November 2018 election. If Cotton stays in the Senate  his current term doesn't end until 2020.
Tillerson's future came up in the Oval Office earlier this month at a meeting in which White House officials closest to the president agreed the Texan should go â and soon â said one individual who consults regularly with the administration. But  Trump  never signed off  and officials have struggled to focus  his  attention on the matter  the individual said.
No matter how long Tillerson is allowed to stay on  his stature and ability to speak on  Trump 's behalf has been impaired  it is widely agreed.","After months of clashes on policy and personality   President Donald Trump  is considering ousting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replacing  him  with hard-nosed CIA Director Mike Pompeo following less than a year on the job  senior U.S. officials said as turmoil within  Trump 's national security team burst into the open.

4965,GOP Dems show no sign of retreat as in shutdown's first day,Donald Trump,"The closure of many government agencies was a striking display of Washington dysfunction  played out on the one-year anniversary of  President Donald Trump 's inauguration  and there was more finger-pointing than signs of bipartisan dealmaking.
 Trump  made light of the debacle in a tweet that Democrats ""wanted to give me a nice present"" to mark the start of  his  second year in office.
 The president  spoke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R-Ky.  to discuss the next possible steps  while chief of staff John Kelly also worked the phones. White House negotiators  legislative affairs director Marc Short and budget chief Mick Mulvaney  went to Capitol Hill to meet with House Republicans  who emerged holding fast to their stance they would not negotiate while the government was shuttered.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D-N.Y.  said voters will fault  Trump  and the GOP. He blamed  Trump  for reneging on a near-deal that Schumer said the two men had approached during a White House meeting Friday.
""Negotiating with  President Trump  is like negotiating with Jell-O "" Schumer said.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said  Trump  had earned an ""F'' for ""failure in leadership."" She said Republicans are ""so incompetent and negligent that they couldn't get it together to keep the government open.""
Arguing that  Trump 's predecessors ""weaponized"" that shutdown  Mulvaney said his budget office would direct agencies to work to mitigate the impact this time  although it was unclear how long that was possible. That position is a striking role reversal for the conservative former congressman who was one of the architects of the 2013 shutdown.
 Trump  said Democrats ""could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead."" In a series of tweets hours after the shutdown began  the president tried to make the case for Americans to elect more Republicans to Congress in November ""in order to power through this mess."" He noted that there are 51 Republicans in the 100-member Senate  and it often takes 60 votes to advance legislation.
 Trump  and Schumer tried to cut a last-minute deal that would have included greater military spending and money for a wall along the Mexican border. But the talks fell apart almost as abruptly as they started.
 Trump  had been set to leave Friday afternoon to attend a fundraiser at  his  estate in Palm Beach  Florida  where  he  intended to make the inauguration anniversary. But  he  remained in Washington.
The last shutdown came in 2013. Tea party Republicans  in a strategy not unlike the one Schumer is employing now  sought to use a must-pass budget bill to try to force President Barack Obama to delay implementation of his health care law. At the time   Trump  told ""Fox & Friends"" that the ultimate blame for a shutdown lies at the top.

4966,The 10 best things Trump has done in Year One,Donald Trump,"As we approach the end of President Donald Trump's first year in office  the list of extraordinary things he has done â for both good and ill â is nothing short of remarkable.  Trump  inspires such deep emotions in  his  critics and supporters that many have struggled to objectively assess  his  presidency. Some are so blinded by their hatred of  Trump  that they refuse to acknowledge the good  he  has done  while others are so blinded by devotion that they overlook almost any transgression.
In my columns  Iâve tried to give  Trump  the credit  he  deserves when  he  does the right thing  while calling  him  out when  he  does the wrong thing. So  here is my list of the 10 best things  Trump  has done in  his  first 11 months. (In a subsequent column  I will give you my list of the 10 worst.)
10.  He  enforced President Barack Obamaâs red line against Syriaâs use of chemical weapons. When the regime of Bashar Assad used a toxic nerve agent on innocent men  women and children   Trump  didn't wring  his  hands.  He  acted quickly and decisively  restoring Americaâs credibility on the world stage that Obama had squandered.
9.  He  has taken a surprisingly tough line with Russia.  Trump  approved a $47 million arms package for Ukraine  sent troops to Polandâs border with Russia and imposed new sanctions on Moscow for violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
8.  He  recognized Jerusalem as Israelâs capital. Four American presidents promised to do it  but only one actually did. This is why the American people elected  Trump .  He  does what  he  promises to do  for better or for worse â in this case  definitely for the better. Even Jeb Bush tweeted his approval.
7. He withdrew from the Paris climate agreement. After George W. Bush pulled out of the disastrous Kyoto treaty  U.S. emissions went down faster than those in much of Europe. The same will be true for  Trump 's departure from the Paris accord. Combined with his approval of the Keystone XL pipeline  and opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploration   Trump  is helping usher in a new age of American energy development.
6.  He  got NATO allies to kick in $12 billion more toward our collective security. Decades of pleading by the Bush and Obama administrations failed to get NATO allies to meet their financial commitments to the alliance  but Trumpâs tough talk and reluctance to affirm America's Article V commitment did the trick. NATO is stronger as a result.
5.  He  has virtually eliminated Islamic State's physical caliphate.  Trump  removed the constraints Obama placed on our military and let it drive the terrorists from their strongholds.
4.  He  admitted  he  was wrong on Afghanistan and reversed Obama's disastrous withdrawal. In a rare admission   Trump  declared: âMy original instinct was to pull out. ... But all my life  I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office. ... A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists.â
3.  He  enacted historic tax and regulatory reform that has unleashed economic growth.  Trump  signed the first comprehensive tax reform in three decades and removed the wet blanket of Obama-era regulations smothering our economy. We are now heading into our third consecutive quarter of above 3 percent growth.
2.  He  is installing conservative judges who will preside for decades. With  his  appointment of Neil M. Gorsuch   Trump  secured a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court  and  he  is moving at record pace to fill the federal appeals courts with young conservative judges.
1.  He   not Hillary Clinton  was inaugurated as president.  Trump  delivered the coup de grace that ended the corrupt  dishonest Clinton political machine.
There are many other significant achievements that did not make the top 10.  Trump  has taken a clear  strong stand against the narco-dictatorship in Venezuela  and  he  renamed the âAsia-Pacificâ the âIndo-Pacificâ to include India in the larger task of preventing Chinese hegemony in Asia.  Trump  has made clear that  he  is willing to use force to stop North Korea from deploying nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of destroying U.S. cities â which has prompted China to finally put real pressure on Pyongyang. Weâll see if it works.
The record of achievement suggests that  despite the noxious tweets and self-inflicted wounds emanating from the White House   Trump  has the potential to become one of the most consequential conservative presidents in modern American history.

4967,Jeff Sessions weathers turbulent year as attorney general,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â Jeff Sessions was in his office  looking unusually deflated. He had just received another public lashing from  President Donald Trump .
 Trump  had browbeaten  his  attorney general for months after Sessions' decision to step aside from the intensifying Russia investigation. Never mind that Sessions has proved fiercely devoted to his boss  carrying out  Trump 's agenda while giving him credit every step of the way.  Trump  was unforgiving.

4970,Trump decertifies the Iran deal and threatens to end it altogether,Trump,"President Donald Trump  announced on Friday that  he  is decertifying  but not withdrawing from or rewriting  the Iran nuclear agreement.
While  the president  delivered blistering criticism of Iran's ""fanatical regime"" and argued the country has violated the spirit of the 2015 agreement that aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon   he  left the deal's fate up to Congress.
""We cannot and will not make this certification ""  Trump  said during a speech at the White House. ""We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence  more terror  and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout.""
 Trump  has effectively given Congress three options: Do not subject Iran to new sanctions and leave the agreement as is; apply sanctions and withdraw from the deal; or renegotiate the deal.
But  Trump  threatened to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement if Congress is unable to agree on a solution  which will require 60 votes and bipartisan support in the Senate.
 Trump  campaigned on  his  promise to ""rip up"" the agreement  which was negotiated by the Obama administration in an effort to curb Iran's nuclear weapons program and is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
But on July 17  the president recertified the JCPOA â which is required by Congress every 90 days â for the second time  after  he  was warned by  his  top aides and cabinet officials that withdrawing would threaten US national security interests and told that  while the deal is imperfect  it provides crucial benefits for the US and its allies.
In August  The Guardian reported that  the Trump White House  was pushing intelligence analysts to provide justification for declaring Iran in violation of the tenants of the deal. That pressure reportedly reminded some analysts of the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
"" They  told me there was a sense of revulsion. There was a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu "" said Ned Price  a former CIA analyst who served as special adviser to former President Barack Obama. ""There was a sense of  'We've seen this movie before.'""

4971,U.S. Decision On Jerusalem Sparks Anger And Concern : The Two,Trump,"Updated at 4:45 a.m.  ET
President Trump 's decision to go ahead with relocating the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem â a move that effectively acknowledges Washington's recognition of the city as Israel's capital â has prompted warnings of violence and concern that the move will scuttle any chance at advancing peace efforts.
During the 2016 campaign   Trump  promised to allow the embassy to be moved  and on Monday   he  allowed a deadline for the next waiver to expire. The White House told reporters on Tuesday that the president would officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital in a speech on Wednesday. The actual establishment of a U.S. embassy compound in Jerusalem would likely take years.
 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  who spoke by telephone with Trump   warned against ""the dangerous consequences such a decision would have to the peace process and to the peace  security and stability of the region and of the world ""  Abbas  spokesman Navil Abu Rudeina said in a statement  according to Al-Jazeera.
In a fiery televised speech on Monday  Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned  Trump  by name that the move constituted a ""red line"" for Muslims.
Speaking in a telephone call to  Trump  on Monday  French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that Jerusalem's status should be resolved as part of a two-state solution that would result in ""Israel and Palestine  living side by side in peace and security with Jerusalem as their capital "" according to a statement put out by France's Foreign Ministry.","Updated at 4:45 a.m.   [TGT]

4972,Trump in San Juan: 'I hate to tell you Puerto Rico but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack',Donald Trump,"Screenshot/White House President Donald Trump  speaks to officials in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.
 President Donald Trump during a visit to Puerto Rico on Tuesday  said the humanitarian-aid response in the Caribbean island and US territory had âthrown our budget a little out of whack.â
âI hate to tell you  Puerto Rico  but youâve thrown our budget a little out of whack  because weâve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico â  Trump  said.
 He  quickly added: âThatâs fine â weâve saved a lot of lives.â
 Trump  went on to compare the devastation in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria last month to that of Hurricane Katrina in the continental US in 2005  saying relatively few people had died as a result of the storm and ensuing loss of power  destruction of infrastructure  and widespread flooding.
âEvery death is a horror â  Trump  said  âbut if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina  and you look at the tremendous â hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died  and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overpowering â¦ and what is your death count?â
âSixteen people versus in the thousands â  Trump  said. âYou can be very proud.â
 Trump âs first public response to the devastation in the US territory came five days after Hurricane Maria hit  in a series of tweets in which he focused on Puerto Ricoâs weak infrastructure and economy.
Days later  he attacked the mayor of San Juan  Carmen Yulin Cruz  after she criticised the inefficiency of the federal governmentâs relief efforts and asked  Trump  to send more help more quickly.
 Trump  also argued that the mayor was criticising him because she had âbeen told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to  Trump .â
 Trump  and Cruz exchanged pleasantries on Tuesday  according to a White House pool report. In his remarks   Trump  thanked Rossello for refusing to âplay politicsâ with the relief effort.
 Trump  has repeatedly lashed out at the mediaâs coverage of the crisis in Puerto Rico  which  he  claims has been a concerted attack on  his  administration and federal first responders.
âFake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to âget  Trump  'â  he  tweeted on Saturday. âNot fair to FR or effort!â","[TGT] speaks to officials in Puerto Rico on Tuesday.

âWould very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange â  Trump  wrote on Twitter. âImportant to the United States! â

4975,Stop Letting the Russians Get Away With It Mr. Trump,Trump,"After the election  they continued to spread confusion and chaos  staging rallies both for and against Mr. Trump  in one case on the same day and in the same city.
 Mr. Trumpâs  defenders  desperate to exculpate  him   seized on a single word â âunwittingâ â that the indictment used to describe certain âmembers  volunteers and supporters of the Trump campaign involved in local community outreachâ who had interacted with the Russians.
In other words  as the White House subtly put it in a statement on Friday  âNO COLLUSION.â The president repeated the claim himself in a tweet  grudgingly acknowledging Russiaâs âanti-US campaign â but emphasizing that it had started âlong before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted.  The Trump campaign  did nothing wrong â no collusion!â
Itâs true that  as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in an announcement  these particular indictments do not allege that any American knew about the influence campaign  nor that  the campaign  had changed the outcome of the election. But thatâs quite different from saying that there was no collusion or impact on the election. As Mr. Rosenstein also said  the special counselâs investigation is continuing  and there are many strands the public still knows little or nothing about.
Remember  Mr. Mueller has already secured two guilty pleas  one from  Mr. Trumpâs  former national security adviser and another from a former campaign adviser  for lying to federal authorities about  their  connections to Russian government officials. He has also charged  Mr. Trumpâs  former campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  and his top aide  Rick Gates  with crimes including money laundering. Mr. Gates appears to be nearing a plea deal himself.
Then there were Russian cyberattacks on the elections systems of at least 39 states. And the hacking of emails sent among members of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign â which  Mr. Trump  openly encouraged.
This is all going to happen again. Intelligence and law enforcement authorities have made that clear. The question is whether  Mr. Trump  will at last accept the fact of Russian interference and take aggressive measures to protect American democracy. For starters   he  could impose the sanctions on Russia that Congress overwhelmingly passed  and that  he  signed into law  last summer. Of course  this would require  him  to overcome  his  mysterious resistance to acting against Russia and to focus on protecting  his  own country.","After the election  they continued to spread confusion and chaos  staging rallies both for and against Mr. Trump  in one case on the same day and in the same city.
 Mr. Trumpâs  defenders  desperate to exculpate  him   seized on a single word â âunwittingâ â that the indictment used to describe certain âmembers  volunteers and supporters of the Trump campaign involved in local community outreachâ who had interacted with the Russians.
In other words  as the White House subtly put it in a statement on Friday  âNO COLLUSION.â The president repeated the claim himself in a tweet  grudgingly acknowledging Russiaâs âanti-US campaign â but emphasizing that it had started âlong before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted.  The Trump campaign  did nothing wrong â no collusion!â
Itâs true that  as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in an announcement  these particular indictments do not allege that any American knew about the influence campaign  nor that  the campaign  had changed the outcome of the election. But thatâs quite different from saying that there was no collusion or impact on the election. As Mr. Rosenstein also said  the special counselâs investigation is continuing  and there are many strands the public still knows little or nothing about.
Remember  Mr. Mueller has already secured two guilty pleas  one from  Mr. Trumpâs  former national security adviser and another from a former campaign adviser  for lying to federal authorities about  their  connections to Russian government officials. He has also charged  Mr. Trumpâs  former campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  and his top aide  Rick Gates  with crimes including money laundering. Mr. Gates appears to be nearing a plea deal himself.
Then there were Russian cyberattacks on the elections systems of at least 39 states. And the hacking of emails sent among members of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign â which   [TGT] openly encouraged.

4976,Mass Pardons Creates Trouble for Trump,Donald Trump,"Starting in January  people who could not have pronounced ""emoluments"" a month previously were opining confidently that  President Donald Trump  was violating the Constitutionâs clause about them. Now we're having to consider just how far  the presidentâs  pardon power runs.
 Trump  has reportedly asked  his  aides that question. Now conservative lawyers David Rivkin and Lee Casey are urging  him  to use the pardon power expansively  to block prosecutors from investigating and charging ""anyone involved in supposed collusion with Russia or Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign "" including  the president himself . Their Wall Street Journal op-ed goes even further  advising pardons for anyone involved in arguably related Obama administration misconduct.
Whether the courts would be obliged to respect a presidential self-pardon is a disputed question. But letâs assume that judges could not review the pardons that Rivkin and Casey recommend  as they cannot review the vast run of pardons.  Trump  should restrain  himself  from issuing these pardons even if  he  has the legal power to grant them â and even if  his  anger over special prosecutor Robert Muellerâs investigation of possible collusion between  his  campaign and Russia tempts  him  to make them.
Pardons all around wonât make for national harmony anyway. They would make the controversies already swirling around  Trump  burn hotter. They would lead to more and louder calls for impeachment. And they should.
But abuse of the pardon power qualifies  and using pardons to short-circuit an investigation that threatens the presidentâs political interests would be an abuse. Letâs hope  Trump  rejects this bad advice.","Starting in January  people who could not have pronounced ""emoluments"" a month previously were opining confidently that   [TGT] was violating the Constitutionâs clause about them.

4977,What is the nuclear arsenal available to President Trump ?,Trump,"President Trump  has made  his  views on nuclear weapons very clear â before taking office   he  tweeted that ""[the United States] must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.""

4978,VA House Dems Leader on âA Massive Victory Of Unprecedented Proportionsâ,Trump,"We knew our elections would be viewed in a national context. In fact  I argued in a Washington Postpiece published in June 2017 that the Virginia elections would be a far better bellwether for politics in the post-Trump election era than races such as the special election in Georgiaâs 6th Congressional District. The Clinton-Kaine ticketâs performance in Virginia proved to us that there were Democratic votes to be gotten  if we could only get them to the polls. We have now seen the results  and they bode well for the future of the Commonwealth and the country.
It all starts with candidates. After last yearâs election  Virginians woke up. We were immediately contacted by people throughout the state who wanted to run for some office; it was âraining candidates.â What emerged was the finest crop of candidates that we have ever assembled. They began running early  were trained early  and  in many cases  assembled their teams in January and February. Many were knocking doors by March and raising the substantial sums of money that would be necessary to tell their stories and engage with their constituents. You simply cannot win without good candidates  people who know how to connect with their communities and fashion a message that speaks directly to local needs. While some will argue that this election was âall about Trump â we knew we could not beat entrenched incumbents with an âanti-Trump messageâ alone. We had to have something more and we found it in every single one of these candidates.
 Trump  And Base Energy
We knew we could not win without increasing voter turnout  and  Trump  became our greatest asset. Early in the campaign  we assembled a matrix that projected how many additional House seats would be in play for every 1 percent increase in turnout. Voter turnout in state races is notoriously low  and we saw that if we increased the Democratic turnout by 5 percent  we could flip as many as 17 seats. Few believed us  but the numbers were always there  and preliminary turnout figures suggest that the increase approached 5 percent  rising from 43 percent in 2013 to about 47.6 percent. This surge in turnout was undoubtedly due to the â Trump  factor;â House Republican incumbents refused to distance themselves from the President and it hurt them badly. In some cases  they even made the mistake of embracing Trumpâ using nasty advertising strategies and divisive campaign mail. On election day  Virginians sent a message that was as loud and clear as the sound of an avalanche careening down a mountain pass; Trumpâs policies and style were clearly rejected.","We knew our elections would be viewed in a national context.

4979,Democrats beware Trump Derangement Syndrome,Donald Trump,"After  President Donald Trump âs first State of the Union address  I am ready to send a version of Horowitzâs message to congressional Democrats. As I used to hear an old Chicago Democratic ward boss say: Donât get mad  get smart.
Donât just sit on your hands and pout while  President Trump  takes advantage of the one thing  he  knows how to do better than most of  his  fellow politicians do: video salesmanship.
I take no glee in making this critique. Iâm not a fan of Trumpâs politics   his  vulgarity   his  exaggerations and  his  outright falsehoods when  he  speaks. I donât like the way  he  deliberately drives wedges between racial  ethnic and gender identity groups and blows dog-whistle kisses to the intolerant right.
But consider the congressional Democrats who decided to sit silently and look visibly displeased throughout the speech  even when it touched on issues or developments of which they approved â such as a record dip in black unemployment. The Democrats are understandably displeased that  Trump  brags about that statistic as if it reflects a trend that started on  his  watch  when it actually began in 2011 under Obama.
But  ah  it is not the facts or ideas that make a difference in the political impact of major events. It is the optics. As long as  Trump  is seen by  his  supporters and persuadable moderates as reaching out to other races and standing up for America  the details donât matter. Itâs how people feel about you that counts. In  his  mastery of those âinstincts â as  Trump  likes to explain   he  comes closest to Ronald Reagan  the nationâs only other president to come from the entertainment industry.
Like Reagan  Trumpâs stagecraft at the State of the Union was outstanding  befitting a man who spent most of his adult life building his brand as a celebrity through celebrity gossip media and his own reality TV shows. More comfortable with ad libs to a rally crowd than with reading a teleprompter   Trump  filled the speech with callouts to guests in  his  audience who had poignant  tragic  heroic or uplifting stories to tell.
Reagan  in fact  was the first president to amplify the impact of the State of the Union address by calling out notable audience members in 1982. He had one guest that year.  Trump  had 15 this year.
Such is the power and majesty of the State of the Union. In the hands of a savvy entertainer or pitchman â Reagan and  Trump  were both â the majesty of the occasion can easily make any political adversaries look small.
So whatever message the Democrats had in mind as they decided to protest by refusing to stand or clap for  Trump   it didnât have much of a chance against Trumpâs stagecraft. He seems to enjoy making smoke come out of his opponentsâ ears â like the professional wrestlers with whom he used to work in the WWE. Show public anger at  Trump ? Go ahead. He welcomes it.
Yet  ironically   Trump  actually showed surprisingly significant movement toward the Dems in his speech. Sure  he might reverse himself later  as he has in the past. Heâs already getting pressure from the right  for example  for his surprisingly progressive offer of a âpathway to citizenshipâ for immigrants brought here unlawfully as children.

 Trump  blamed Democrats for a possible shutdown.
 Trump  suggested the biggest sticking point was Democratic insistence that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in legislation to avert a shutdown.
 President Donald Trump  said Wednesday that a government shutdown ""could happen "" two days before the deadline to pass a funding bill.
 Trump  said the main threat to a shutdown is Democrats' insistence on the inclusion of legislation to codify the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as part of the funding bill.
""The Democrats are really looking at something that is very dangerous for our country  "" Trump  said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. ""They are looking at shutting down.

4982,Former Koch Brothers Exec Now White House Staffer Marc Short: Trump 'Willing to Expand' DACA Amnesty,Trump,"Former â Never Trumpâ  Koch brothers executive turned White House staffer  Marc Short  told NBCâs Meet the Press that  President Trump  would be âwilling to expandâ an amnesty beyond the nearly 800 000 illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
During an interview with NBCâs Chuck Todd  Short made the claim that in negotiations to give reward illegal aliens with amnesty   Trump  would be âwillingâ to give a pathway to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status to not just the nearly 800 000 DACA illegal aliens enrolled in the program  but also the illegal aliens who are eligible for DACA  an unlawful population that would mean 3.5 million illegal aliens being given amnesty.
MARC SHORT: Things that need to be clarified on that because sometimes what Democrats have done is say theyâll authorize it without appropriating it which is a game here. Democrats have voted before to authorize lots of money that never happens. So we need to clarify that. But we see progress. On our side they said they want the 690 000 DACA population expanded. Senator Durbin has made the case that say many people did not register and they should not be held harmful. Weâve been willing to expand that population. So thereâs progress happening here which  again  leads us  Chuck  so then why are we shutting down the government? [Emphasis added] CHUCK TODD: Well  I guess thenâGraham/Durbin say that they put this offer out here. Now youâve got Chuck Schumer saying it. So why not  why not say  âOkay  it seems like we have the parameters for a deal.â Democrats are willing. You guys are arguing over whether youâre going to appropriate it or not. But it seems as if what they thoughtâChuck Schumer says what he thought he had an agreement of that the president changed his mind a few hours later. I guess the question I have for you is whoâs in charge of the presidentâs position on immigration because what heâlook at Lindsey Graham. There was twoâhe calls him Tuesday  Trump  versus Thursday  Trump . Whatâs the difference here? MARC SHORT:  President Trump  is being crystal clear on what  he  wants and  he  has not wavered in that  Chuck. What Lindsey Graham and Senator Durbin offered to the president was to say  âHere  weâve narrowed it down to these four areas youâve asked us to.â When they came over to the White House and presented them we found them to be woefully insufficient inside those four areas. But nonetheless we had narrowed down the broader debate into a smaller one. We feel like we are making progress on the overall discussion. We think we will get to a solution. What befuddles is to say weâre going to not pay millions of our troops serving around the world. And weâre not going to pay our border agents until  until whatâwe donât know what it is theyâre asking for. Theyâve said  âGive us a shorter CR.â Tonight the Senate Republicans vote  instead of a four-week CR on a three-week CR. And yet Democrats are still are unwilling to give us their vote to keep the government open.
Shortâs statement does not align with populist conservative Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) statement on Saturday that  Trumpâs  standpoint on immigration has ânot withheld or shifted  its  positionâ on immigration  where the White House has consistently said they would be open to amnesty for only illegal aliens enrolled in DACA if they were given a slew of pro-American immigration reforms in return.
 The reforms Trump has been demanding for months  include full funding for a border wall  an end to the process of âchain migration â and an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery program. According to the White Houseâs longstanding position   these reforms  would be in exchange for legal status for only illegal aliens enrolled in the DACA program.
Likewise  the Visa Lottery  which Trump has demanded an end to  randomly imports 50 000 foreign nationals every year from a multitude of countries  including those with known terrorism problemsâsuch as Afghanistan  Algeria  Egypt  Iraq  Lebanon  Libya  Nigeria  Saudi Arabia  Somalia  Trinidad and Tobago  Venezuela  Yemen  and Uzbekistan.
A Pulse Opinion Research poll conducted this month found that 60 percent of American likely voters wanted to see the Visa Lottery ended  as Trump has demanded. The same poll also found that nearly 60 percent of likely voters want to see chain migration ended as part of any immigration deal.
Despite now being a part of the Trump administration  Short has a long history opposing the president and his agenda  as well as working alongside the Koch brothers  two pro-mass immigration billionaires who are major donors to the Republican establishment  as the director of the group Freedom Partners.
In May 2016  during the height of the Republican presidential primary  where  Trump  was taking the country by storm on  his  populist-nationalist âAmerica Firstâ agenda  Short was heading an effort to derail the then-front-runner.
At the time  National Review exclusively reported that Short was leading an effort inside the Koch brothersâ organizations to take down  Trump  and  his  agenda  partly by supporting Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)  who infamously helped author the Gang of Eight amnesty bill that would have given the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens in the U.S. a pathway to citizenship:
On a frigid Tuesday in February  a team of top political operatives from the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce  the umbrella group that controls political activities for the sprawling donor network led by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch  arrived in Kansas for a meeting that they hoped would turn the tide of the presidential campaign. Theyâd set aside $150 million to spend on paid media alone  to be spread across campaigns at the federal  state  and local levels. Yet they had not been authorized to spend a dime on the White House race. Marc Short  then president of Freedom Partners  wanted to change that. He led a faction inside the Koch network that had become convinced of the need to neutralize  Donald Trump  before  his  momentum made  him  unstoppable. Fresh off  Trumpâs  landslide victory in New Hampshire one week earlier  and staring down another likely  Trump  win in South Carolina that Saturday  Short and  his  lieutenants had come to Wichita to present Charles Koch with a detailed  eight-figure blueprint for derailing the Republican front-runner on Super Tuesday  when eleven states would vote. They hoped to get the green light to hammer  Trump  with ads in the states where  he  was most vulnerable.
Just a week after  Shortâs  efforts to lead a full-fledged Koch-funded operation against  Trump    he  signed onto the Rubio campaign.
After Short left the Kochâs Freedom Partners   he  praised the open borders  billionaire donors  saying  âCharles and David have built an amazing network of donors and activists  and their investments in future generations will pay huge dividends.â
Marc Short  who's running legislative affairs in #Trump WH  previously led 'Never Trump' mvmt inside Koch orgsâ¦ https://t.co/bX4LYR7i9k â John Binder ð½ (@JxhnBinder) September 19  2017","Former â Never Trumpâ  Koch brothers executive turned White House staffer  Marc Short  told NBCâs Meet the Press that   [TGT] would be âwilling to expandâ an amnesty beyond the nearly 800 000 illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
During an interview with NBCâs Chuck Todd  Short made the claim that in negotiations to give reward illegal aliens with amnesty    [TGT] would be âwillingâ to give a pathway to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status to not just the nearly 800 000 DACA illegal aliens enrolled in the program  but also the illegal aliens who are eligible for DACA  an unlawful population that would mean 3.5 million illegal aliens being given amnesty.
MARC SHORT: Things that need to be clarified on that because sometimes what Democrats have done is say theyâll authorize it without appropriating it which is a game here. Democrats have voted before to authorize lots of money that never happens. So we need to clarify that. But we see progress. On our side they said they want the 690 000 DACA population expanded. Senator Durbin has made the case that say many people did not register and they should not be held harmful. Weâve been willing to expand that population. So thereâs progress happening here which  again  leads us  Chuck  so then why are we shutting down the government? [Emphasis added] CHUCK TODD: Well  I guess thenâGraham/Durbin say that they put this offer out here. Now youâve got Chuck Schumer saying it. So why not  why not say  âOkay  it seems like we have the parameters for a deal.â Democrats are willing. You guys are arguing over whether youâre going to appropriate it or not. But it seems as if what they thoughtâChuck Schumer says what he thought he had an agreement of that the president changed his mind a few hours later. I guess the question I have for you is whoâs in charge of the presidentâs position on immigration because what heâlook at Lindsey Graham. There was twoâhe calls him Tuesday   [TGT]  . Whatâs the difference here? MARC SHORT:   [TGT] is being crystal clear on what   [TGT]   wants and   [TGT]   has not wavered in that  Chuck. What Lindsey Graham and Senator Durbin offered to the president was to say  âHere  weâve narrowed it down to these four areas youâve asked us to.â When they came over to the White House and presented them we found them to be woefully insufficient inside those four areas. But nonetheless we had narrowed down the broader debate into a smaller one. We feel like we are making progress on the overall discussion. We think we will get to a solution. What befuddles is to say weâre going to not pay millions of our troops serving around the world. And weâre not going to pay our border agents until  until whatâwe donât know what it is theyâre asking for. Theyâve said  âGive us a shorter CR.â Tonight the Senate Republicans vote  instead of a four-week CR on a three-week CR. And yet Democrats are still are unwilling to give us their vote to keep the government open.
Shortâs statement does not align with populist conservative Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) statement on Saturday that   [TGT] standpoint on immigration has ânot withheld or shifted   [TGT]   positionâ on immigration  where the White House has consistently said they would be open to amnesty for only illegal aliens enrolled in DACA if they were given a slew of pro-American immigration reforms in return.
  [TGT] include full funding for a border wall  an end to the process of âchain migration â and an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery program. According to the White Houseâs longstanding position    [TGT] would be in exchange for legal status for only illegal aliens enrolled in the DACA program.
Likewise  the Visa Lottery  which  [TGT]  has demanded an end to  randomly imports 50 000 foreign nationals every year from a multitude of countries  including those with known terrorism problemsâsuch as Afghanistan  Algeria  Egypt  Iraq  Lebanon  Libya  Nigeria  Saudi Arabia  Somalia  Trinidad and Tobago  Venezuela  Yemen  and Uzbekistan.
A Pulse Opinion Research poll conducted this month found that 60 percent of American likely voters wanted to see the Visa Lottery ended  as  [TGT]  has demanded. The same poll also found that nearly 60 percent of likely voters want to see chain migration ended as part of any immigration deal.
Despite now being a part of the Trump administration  Short has a long history opposing the president and his agenda  as well as working alongside the Koch brothers  two pro-mass immigration billionaires who are major donors to the Republican establishment  as the director of the group Freedom Partners.
In May 2016  during the height of the Republican presidential primary  where   [TGT] was taking the country by storm on  his  populist-nationalist âAmerica Firstâ agenda  Short was heading an effort to derail the then-front-runner.
At the time  National Review exclusively reported that Short was leading an effort inside the Koch brothersâ organizations to take down   [TGT] and  his  agenda  partly by supporting Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL)  who infamously helped author the Gang of Eight amnesty bill that would have given the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens in the U.S. a pathway to citizenship:
On a frigid Tuesday in February  a team of top political operatives from the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce  the umbrella group that controls political activities for the sprawling donor network led by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch  arrived in Kansas for a meeting that they hoped would turn the tide of the presidential campaign. Theyâd set aside $150 million to spend on paid media alone  to be spread across campaigns at the federal  state  and local levels. Yet they had not been authorized to spend a dime on the White House race. Marc Short  then president of Freedom Partners  wanted to change that. He led a faction inside the Koch network that had become convinced of the need to neutralize   [TGT] before  his  momentum made  him  unstoppable. Fresh off  Trumpâs  landslide victory in New Hampshire one week earlier  and staring down another likely  Trump  win in South Carolina that Saturday  Short and  his  lieutenants had come to Wichita to present Charles Koch with a detailed  eight-figure blueprint for derailing the Republican front-runner on Super Tuesday  when eleven states would vote. They hoped to get the green light to hammer   [TGT] with ads in the states where   [TGT]   was most vulnerable.
Just a week after  Shortâs  efforts to lead a full-fledged Koch-funded operation against   [TGT]      [TGT]   signed onto the Rubio campaign.
After Short left the Kochâs Freedom Partners    [TGT]   praised the open borders  billionaire donors  saying  âCharles and David have built an amazing network of donors and activists  and their investments in future generations will pay huge dividends.â

4984,David Horowitz: Democratsâ Hatred of Trump Is Going to Bring Them Down,Donald Trump,"Donald Trumpâs State of the Union address was perfectly pitched for the political moment.
 Trump  did not use the word âseditionâ to describe the law-breaking and Constitution-negating actions of  his  Democratic predecessor or the Democrats assembled in the chamber of the House.  He  provided instead an opening to them to abandon their âresistanceâ â resistance to the expressed will of the American voting public which has led to a relentless sabotage of the democratic process. In sum   he  offered a hand to  his  Democratic haters  and they slapped it away.
When  Trump  summarized the successes of  his  first year in office   he  emphasized how the prosperity of  his  first twelve months impacted the lives and hopes of ordinary Americans  wage laborers and others whom the eight years of the Obama presidency had left behind. In doing so  he  exposed the Democrats in the most dramatic way imaginable.
Under  his  policies   he  boasted  black and Hispanic unemployment are record lows. As  he  said this and the Republican side of the house rose to its feet in applause the TV camera panned to the morose members of the Democratsâ Black Caucus  sitting on their hands and showing America that the last thing they care about is their black constituents. What they care about is their hatred for Trump  and about not disturbing the biggest lie of the political season: that the White House is the headquarters of a âwhite supremacyâ movement intent on keeping black Americans down and making them suffer."," [TGT] âs State of the Union address was perfectly pitched for the political moment.

His  tax cuts amidst a firestorm of negative media throughout  his  presidency are nothing less than astounding.  He  managed to turn  his  sweeping tax-reform quest into the law of the land.
The campaign promises candidate  Trump  pledged during the 2016 presidential campaign continue to be met despite wild opposition from both sides of the aisle. It began with  his  selection of constitutionalist judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Despite wildly inflammatory rhetoric from the left   Trump  managed to tilt the Court more to the center.
Then there was  his  pledge to reduce federal regulations across the board. Although  he  is nowhere near  his  planned goal of two burdensome regulations removed for every new one installed   his  quest is on a record pace.
 Trump  pledged to defeat ISIS  the radical terrorist group.  He  left the task to the U.S. military and one year later 98 percent of previously held territory by these savages has been reclaimed.
 The president  has put the world on notice that America will no longer be the fall guy for their incursions and threats. That includes the North Koreans  Iranians  Chinese and the Russians. That was taken a step further with notice by our U.N. ambassador America will no longer tolerate the worldâs dismissal of our monetary contributions and this countryâs independence.

 Donald Trump  is building a success story that the lopsided media cannot contain.  The president  is already planning further tax cuts and  his  infrastructure bill will most certainly have bi-partisan support. The Democrats basically have no choice considering its benefit for all Americans.
 Trump  the successful businessman always has the bigger picture in mind.  He  is setting the stage for the next seven years of  his  presidency. While the opposition puts forth weak 2020 candidates for the presidency such as Biden  Warren and even Hillary   he  forges ahead with ideas America can agree upon: A booming economy  strong military and an American resurgence on the world stage.

4990,LaVar Ball Says He'd Probably Thank China's President Over Donald Trump,Donald Trump,"LaVar Ball suggested  President Donald Trump  stay in  his  lane Monday night during an interview with CNNâs Chris Cuomo.
âIf you help  you shouldnât have to say anything â Ball said of  Trump âs involvement in orchestrating the release of  his  son  UCLA basketball player LiAngelo Ball. LiAngelo was one of three UCLA basketball players arrested and jailed earlier this month for shoplifting in China.
âLet  him  do  his  political affairs and let me handle my son  and letâs just stay in our lane â the elder Ball added.
 The outspoken father  continued to be skeptical that  Trump  was responsible for the release of the three basketball players  all of whom returned to Los Angeles safely last week. The players have been suspended indefinitely from the team.
Last week   Trump  slammed the players for not publicly thanking  him  for their release. The men then held a press conference and thanked the president.
âDid  he  help the boys get out? I donât know â Ball said. âIf I was going to thank somebody  Iâd probably thank President Xi.  He âs the president in China. Somebody can make a suggestion and somebody can do something.â
 Trump  called Ball âvery ungratefulâ in a tweet on Sunday and said  the father  was not taking the allegations seriously enough after  he  downplayed the presidentâs involvement in  his  sonâs release.
âI should have left them in jail!â  Trump  tweeted.
The White House later walked back Trumpâs comment  saying  he  did not mean the comment and was responding to the elder Ballâs skepticism in the presidentâs direct involvement.","LaVar Ball suggested   [TGT] stay in   [TGT]   lane Monday night during an interview with CNNâs Chris Cuomo.

  [TGT] called Ball âvery ungratefulâ in a tweet on Sunday and said  the father  was not taking the allegations seriously enough after  he  downplayed the presidentâs involvement in  his  sonâs release.
âI should have left them in jail!â   [TGT] tweeted.
The White House later walked back Trumpâs comment  saying   [TGT]   did not mean the comment and was responding to the elder Ballâs skepticism in the presidentâs direct involvement.",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,,,,,

Some slight consolation for  Trump  may be that he was crowned the most tweeted about elected world leader this year. But as various stories have noted  heâs often mentioned in a negative light.

4992,More than 200 NFL players sit or kneel during national anthem,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump 's criticism of players who kneel during the national anthem sparked angry protests around the National Football League Sunday  as about 200 players sat  knelt or raised their fists in defiance.
As he prepared to board Air Force One to return to Washington from New Jersey   Trump  said the players protesting the anthem were ""very disrespectful to our country"" and called again on owners to stop what  he  considers unpatriotic displays in America's most popular sport.
""This has nothing to do with race  "" Trump  said. ""This has to do with respect for our country.""
The NFL and its players  often at odds  used Sunday's anthems to show unity. One of  Trump 's biggest supporters in the NFL  Patriots owner Robert Kraft  joined the chorus when he expressed ""deep disappointment"" with  Trump .
""I like Bob very much. He's my friend. He gave me a Super Bowl ring a month ago. So he's a good friend of mine and I want him to do what he wants to do ""  Trump  said. ""... We have great people representing our country  especially our soldiers our first responders and they should be treated with respect.
A handful of NFL players had been continuing Kaepernick's protest this season  but that ballooned Sunday following  Trump 's two-day weekend rant. It began with the president calling for NFL protesters to be fired and continued Saturday when he rescinded a White House invitation for the NBA champion Golden State Warriors over star Stephen Curry's criticism.
""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners  when somebody disrespects our flag  you'd say  'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired '""  Trump  said to loud applause Friday night at a rally in Huntsville  Alabama.
""Standing with locked arms is good  kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!""  Trump  tweeted Sunday.

4993,Are Republicans sowing the seeds of Trump 's demise?,Donald Trump,"When  Donald Trump  became  his  party's nominee for president in 2016  the many Republicans who had reservations about  him  convinced themselves that the bargain they made could be fruitful for everyone. They'd stand by  him  despite the kind of person  he  is  and in return they'd get the policy results they were after.
Sure  from time to time they'd have to evade uncomfortable questions about  his  latest idiotic tweet or another woman (or five or ten) accusing  him  of sexual assault  but it would be worth it.
But it has turned out that  Trump  demands more than they thought. They've signed on with a cult of personality  in which one goal supersedes all others: Protect the president no matter what. In Congress  as CNN's Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb report  they're doing their part:
""Top Republicans on Capitol Hill have made a concerted decision in their Russia inquiries: They are staying away from digging into the finances of President Donald Trump and his family.
""Six Republican leaders of key committees told CNN they see little reason to pursue those lines of inquiry or made no commitments to do so â even as Democrats say determining whether there was a financial link between  Trump   his family  his business and Russians is essential to understanding whether there was any collusion in the 2016 elections.
""Republicans have resisted calls to issue subpoenas for bank records  seeking  Trump 's tax returns or sending letters to witnesses to determine whether there were any  Trump  financial links to Russian actors â calling the push nothing more than a Democratic fishing expedition.""
They aren't saying that they've looked into the possibility of these ties and found there's nothing to them; they're saying they don't even want to look. This is a party that launched seven separate congressional investigations of Benghazi. It's enough to make you think they're afraid that if they started poking around in  Trump 's financial connections to Russia  they'd find that he's guilty of something. While it was always going to be tricky for this Congress to investigate the Russia scandal  the ""investigations"" are rapidly turning into a joke.
One of the odd things about the way Republicans have approached the entire Russia scandal is that there's a halfway plausible story they could tell about the 2016 election which wouldn't implicate  Trump  but would still be at least somewhat consistent with what we know so far. It would say that Russia was trying not to help  Trump  so much as just to cause chaos in our election  and while the Russians certainly reached out to members of  Trump 's family and  his  campaign to engineer some kind of cooperation  it never amounted to much.
That account of events is extremely generous to everyone around  Trump . But at least it has a remote connection to some of the facts  enough to make it seem like the one telling that story would almost be acting in good faith. And it's a position some in the GOP have taken. The party as a whole  however  has adopted the ""nothing to see  move along"" position instead  which is likely a tactical mistake. If you're really clever  what you want to do is pretend that you're eager to get to the bottom of the scandal while quietly sabotaging the investigation. But Republicans aren't even bothering to pretend. They've all but announced that for them there is no higher priority than protecting  Trump   not even the national security of the United States.
Let's take  for example  the question of the president's tax returns  which he has insisted on keeping hidden despite the fact that there has never been a president in American history whose tax returns the public had a more pressing interest in seeing. The CNN piece notes that Sen. Ron Wyden has been asking to see those returns and ""to obtain records about a lucrative 2008 real estate deal between  Trump  and a Russian billionaire that raised questions among Democrats about potential money laundering and suspect business dealings."" Sen. Orrin Hatch  who chairs the Senate Finance Committee  has refused. ""He doesn't want to give up his tax returns  and I believe he's right "" Hatch says.
Now imagine that Democrats take the House. They would be able to release  Trump 's returns by use of a little-used provision in the law  which allows the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee  the Senate Finance Committee  or the Joint Committee on Taxation to request from the IRS any American's tax returns  including the president's. The chair could then share it with the rest of his or her committee  which could then vote to release the returns to all members of the chamber. Once 435 members of the House have  Trump 's returns  they'd be public in about 12 seconds.
If Republicans had been making a good-faith effort to fully investigate the Russia scandal  they might be able to say in January 2019 to their newly empowered Democratic colleagues that releasing  Trump 's returns against  his  wishes is a radical move that would set a bad precedent. It's possible they could win over a few Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee with that argument  just enough to stop the release  since Democrats are far more open to arguments about precedents and the long-term health of institutions. But after Republicans spent the first two years of the  Trump  presidency running roughshod over every norm in sight and making clear that they only want to protect  Trump   an appeal to norms and precedents will surely fall on deaf ears.","When   [TGT] became   [TGT]   party's nominee for president in 2016  the many Republicans who had reservations about   [TGT]   convinced themselves that the bargain they made could be fruitful for everyone.

4995,NPR Poll: After Parkland Number of Americans Who Want Gun Restrictions Grows : NPR,Trump,"The only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by President Trump â the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools.
 Trump 's in sync with  his  base
The president's outspoken criticism of schools as gun-free zones and  his  recent rhetoric calling for a comprehensive gun bill suggests  he 's acutely aware of how  his  base voters feel about gun policies â and the growing desire  even among Republicans  for some sort of stricter gun-control legislation.
""We see in this study  a majority of Republicans saying that they are supportive of a variety of different gun-control measures  many of which  Trump  mentioned explicitly in  his  [White House] briefing "" said Chris Jackson  director of the public polling team at Ipsos. ""And that's in contrast to a lot of Republican elected officials  who have taken a much more Second Amendment absolutist stance.""
Although  Trump  remains friendly with the National Rifle Association and its leadership  he's recently shown a willingness to challenge GOP orthodoxy on guns.
In a televised White House meeting with legislators Wednesday   Trump  surprised (and angered) many of his fellow conservative lawmakers with his ad-hoc approach to gun-control policy. He questioned his fellow Republicans' relationship with the NRA and dismissed a concealed carry provision that conservatives wanted as a trade-off for some restrictions.
""They have great power over you people. They have less power over me ""  Trump  told GOP lawmakers at that meeting  adding  ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.""
 Trump  suggested  he  was open to expanding background checks and possibly raising the age to purchase an AR-15. (Both popular measures  according to the NPR/Ipsos poll).
 ""President Trump  is actually closer to where the Republican base is on the issue of guns than a lot of Republican elected officials ""  Jackson  said. ""And I think this is something that  Trump  has done a lot through  his  political career;  he  often times finds  himself  closer to the Republican base than the establishment does.""
Of course   the president  has a history of adopting popular opinions and speaking to the polls  and then subsequently reversing  his  position and reverting to a more traditionally conservative attitude  as  he  did with  his  initial support for a bill that would protect DACA recipients from deportation.
The split over  Trump 's handling of the Parkland shooting situation seems to mirror  his  overall approval rating and shows how much partisanship affects people's perspectives â 71 percent of Republicans approved of how the president handled the aftermath of the school shooting  compared to just 9 percent of Democrats.","The only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by  [TGT]  â the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools.

4997,Trump Administration Is Trying to Hide the $5.8 Billion Its Tip,Trump,"Trump Administration Is Trying to Hide the $5.8 Billion  Its  Tip-Stealing Plan Would Cost Workers
A recent study shows the costs of the Trump Department of Laborâs proposed rule that would allow employers to steal workers' tips  and theyâre huge.

In a deeply unusual move  DOL did not provide an estimate of the amount of tips that will be transferred from workers to employers (which is one reason we did so). This is unusual because agencies are required by law as a part of the rulemaking process to assess all quantifiable costs and benefits to the fullest extent possible.

To ask the question is to answer it; any good-faith estimate would have shown this rule will result in a substantial shift of tips from workers to employers and the DOL under President Trump â and Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta â is trying to hide that fact.
Thatâs the Trump administration three-step for you: decide to do a bad thing  lie about what its effects will be  and skirt the law to avoid transparency.

5000,The Trump family claimed false heritage for years,Donald Trump,"(CNN)  President Donald Trump  has come under fire for using the name of a famous Native American as a slur -- at an event honoring Native Americans for their service as code talkers in World War II  no less.
 Trump  turned to  his  often-used insult of ""Pocahontas"" to slam Sen. Elizabeth Warren  whom  he  claims has embellished  her  purported Native American heritage. Warren has said  she  was raised being told that  she  is part Native American  but has maintained that  she  never used this aspect of  her  heritage to advance  her  career.
 Trump 's repeated attacks on Warren come despite  his  own family's past efforts to hide their heritage. According to multiple reports from The New York Times and the Boston Globe and a biography   Trump 's father repeatedly sought to conceal the fact that he was the son of German immigrants.
 Fred Trump  sought to pass  himself  off as Swedish amid anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II. According to the biography ""The Trumps: Three Generations that Built an Empire"" by Gwenda Blair   Fred Trump  denied knowing German and did not teach it to  his  children.
 John Walter  a Trump family historian and one of Donald Trump's cousins   said this was an effort to not offend  his  Jewish customers.
"" He  said  'You don't sell apartments after the war if you're German ' "" Walter said in the Boston Globe article. ""So he's Swedish  no problem.""
Even after World War II   Fred Trump  continued to claim  he  was Swedish  according to Walter.
In his book  ""The Art of the Deal "" Donald Trump reaffirmed the myth of his family's origins  writing that his father's father came to America ""from Sweden as a child.""
In reality  Fred Trump's father   Friedrich Trump   immigrated to the United States from the German city of Kallstadt as a teenager in 1885. Blair writes in her biography that  Friedrich Trump  went on to establish several saloons and hotels that doubled as brothels.
One German historian alleges that the  Trump  patriarch was kicked out of Germany for failing to complete mandatory military service and as such was not able to reclaim his German citizenship.
 Donald Trump  eventually acknowledged and embraced  his  German heritage  serving as the grand marshal of the annual German-American Steuben Parade in New York City in 1999. In a video message for the 2011 event   Trump  touted  his  grandfather's immigration story and recalled the earlier parade.
""I'm  a proud German-American "" Donald Trump  added.
Despite  his  public acknowledgment of  his  German heritage  it is unclear if the President has ever fully corrected the record about his family's past claims of being Swedish.
When asked by the Boston Globe why his father claimed he was Swedish   Donald Trump  said  ""Well  he spent time in Sweden. And he talked about Swedish because of the fact  you know  we happened to be at war with Germany  which I guess makes sense in a lot of ways doesn't it?

5002,Trump Uses Vulgar Language To Refer To African Countries Sources Say : NPR,Trump,"Trump Uses Vulgar Language To Refer To African Countries  Sources Say
Updated at  7:10 p.m. ET
President Trump  on Thursday referred to African nations as ""s***hole countries"" during a meeting on immigration with a bipartisan group of senators  according to a Democratic aide and another person familiar with the conversation.
 Trump  made the comment during a discussion of U.S. visa and immigration policies inside the Oval Office.  Trump  was meeting with the senators to discuss a bipartisan plan to grant legal protections to the roughly 800 000 immigrants who are in the country illegally after being brought to the country as children. During the conversation  Trump  also questioned why the U.S would want to accept people from countries like Haiti and said the U.S. should want more people from countries like Norway  the aides said.
The senators had hoped to persuade  Trump  to support their plan  which pairs increased funding for border security with new legal status for immigrants who were previously protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  also known as DACA. The White House rejected the plan and asked the senators to keep working on a new proposal.
The White House issued a statement rejecting ""weak and dangerous stopgap measures"" on immigration but did not deny  Trump 's remarks.
""The President will only accept an immigration deal that adequately addresses the visa lottery system and chain migration â two programs that hurt our economy and allow terrorists into our country "" said deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah. ""Like other nations that have merit-based immigration   President Trump  is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society  grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.""
Later that afternoon  after members of the six-person Senate group presented their agreement to  Trump   Sen. Lindsey Graham  R-S.C.  told reporters there was more negotiating to be done.
The negotiations began in earnest at the end of December  months after  Trump  first announced in September 2017 that DACA would be ending and gave Congress until March 5 of this year to come up with a replacement.
As part of any agreement about DACA   Trump  has insisted that there be funding for a wall on the Southern border with Mexico  which many Democrats have opposed.  He  also called for ending the diversity visa lottery  a State Department program that gives residents of nations with few migrants coming to the U.S. a chance for a green card  and for ending family-based migration (called ""chain migration"" by its opponents) that allows extended family members of immigrants already in the U.S. legally to come to the U.S. as well.","Trump Uses Vulgar Language To Refer To African Countries  Sources Say

He noted that neither the White House nor the State Department had formally contacted him to clarify whether  Trump  had indeed made the comments at an Oval Office meeting Thursday. The remarks were relayed to NPR by a Democratic aide and another person familiar with the discussion.
On Friday morning  roughly 15 hours after the comments were first reported by The Washington Post   Trump  disputed the details reported about  his  words in a series of tweets.
""The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough  but this was not the language used  "" Trump  said  referring to the policy  he  rescinded last year that protected immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
""I never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is  obviously  a very poor and troubled country  "" Trump  tweeted later  on the anniversary of an earthquake that killed at least 200 000 people in Haiti.

WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump  on Wednesday criticized Facebook Inc (FB.O) as  âanti-Trump â and questioned  its  role during the 2016 presidential campaign  amid probes into alleged Russian interference in the election and possible collusion by  Trumpâs  associates.
 His  salvo came as the social media giant prepares to hand over 3 000 political ads to congressional investigators that it has said were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after last yearâs presidential contest.
 Trump  appeared to embrace the focus on the social media network in  his  comments on Wednesday  which also took aim at more traditional medial outlets  long targeted by the president as âfake news.â
âFacebook was always  anti-Trump . The networks were always  anti-Trump  â  Trump  said on Twitter  levelling the same charge against the New York Times and the Washington Post. âCollusion?â

5007,Trump Can't Take Jordan for Granted as Saudi Arabia Evolves,Trump,"Jordan's status as America's BFF in the Arab world faces a surprising new challenge from Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration (with quiet Israeli encouragement) is courting Saudi Arabia's brash crown prince  Mohammed bin Salman. ""MBS "" as he's known  is the glamorous new guest at the American table. Some Jordanians are feeling like the loyal partner whose affections have been forgotten.
MBS is moving into political space long occupied by Jordan. The Saudi leader is trying to repackage the kingdom as a voice of moderate Islam  which has been Jordan's special mission. He's styling himself as an Arab change agent  a role championed by Jordan's King Abdullah II. And MBS is subtly supporting  President Trump 's ""ultimate deal"" on the Israeli-Palestinian problem  despite Jordanian misgivings.
What worries Amman is that  Trump 's disruptive diplomacy â symbolized by  his  decision in December to reverse long-standing U.S. policy and move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem â will cause internal political problems for Jordan  with its large Palestinian population. When Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas denounces Trump's peace process  Jordan fears it will have to pick up the pieces.
The Trump White House's ardor for MBS comes at a moment when Jordan's relations with Riyadh have cooled. A senior Jordanian official cites three key disagreements: The Jordanians didn't send ground troops to join the Saudi invasion of Yemen three years ago. Jordan also balked at the Saudi campaign against Qatar  perhaps mindful of the 50 000 Jordanians working in Doha. Finally  the Jordanians disagreed with Saudi calls for a legal crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood  believing that the GID's covert containment of the Brotherhood was more effective.","Jordan's status as America's BFF in the Arab world faces a surprising new challenge from Saudi Arabia.

5008,Obama slams state of US politics in 1st post,Barack Obama,"Former President Barack Obama  made  his  much-anticipated first post-presidential appearance on the campaign trail Thursday  speaking at events for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia before elections there next month.
Interested in  Barack Obama ? Add  Barack Obama  as an interest to stay up to date on the latest  Barack Obama  news  video  and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
Appearing at a rally in Richmond  Virginia with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam   Obama  commented on the political climate in the country.
âFolks don't feel good right now about what they see  they don't feel as if our public life reflects our best â  Obama  said. âInstead of our politics reflecting our values  we've got politics infecting our communities.â
 Obama  did not mention President Donald Trump by name  but did offer some pointed criticism that appeared to be directed at him.
""You'll notice I haven't been commenting on politics a lot lately  but here's one thing I know: If you have to win a campaign by dividing people you're not going to be able to govern them. You won't be able to unite them later if that's how you start â  Obama  told the crowd of thousands at the Greater Richmond Convention Center.
 Obama  also got animated when offering some deeply personal thoughts on the events over the summer in Charlottesville.
âWe saw what happened in Charlottesville  but we also saw what happened after Charlottesville  when the biggest gatherings of all rejected fear and rejected hate and the decency and goodwill of the American people came out â  Obama  said. âThat's how we rise. We don't rise up by repeating the past  we rise up by learning from the past.â
The race between Northam and former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie is considered the only competitive statewide race in the nation this year  raising the stakes for  Obamaâs  visit to the state with the election less than three weeks away.
 Obama  slammed Gillespie for television advertisements attacking Northam over recent MS-13 gang violence in the Commonwealth  dismissing it as nothing more than fear-mongering.
âIt's a tactic by the way that shows Ralph's opponent doesn't really think very highly of Virginians â  Obama  said  adding  âIf he honestly thought these were serious issues he'd offer serious solutions. But he's not because what he's really trying to deliver is fear. What he really believes is if you scare enough voters you might score just enough votes to win an election.â
 The former president  is still popular in Virginia  a state  he  won in 2008 and 2012.
Appearing at an event earlier in the day in Newark with Phil Murphy  who served as U.S. Ambassador to Germany during the  Obama  administration   the former president  praised Murphy as the right choice for New Jersey voters.
""When Phil and his family said Iâm ready to go  Iâm willing to step out there and step into what can be a pretty tough political environment  I wasnât surprised because I knew him ""  Obama  said. ""I knew their character.""
 Obama âs re-emergence comes as President Trump has taken aim at various parts of his legacy  including the Iran nuclear agreement and the Affordable Care Act and as the controversy around Trumpâs interactions with families of fallen U.S. soldiers persists.
 Obama  shied away from calling out Trump directly in  his  remarks in Newark  instead hammering  his  critique of the state of U.S. politics today.","[TGT] made   [TGT]   much-anticipated first post-presidential appearance on the campaign trail Thursday  speaking at events for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia before elections there next month.

5009,How To Fix The Trade Deficit With Japan? For Donald Trump Automakers Play A Big Role,Donald Trump,"U.S. President Donald Trump  perplexed a gathering of business leaders in Tokyo this Monday with remarks about Japanese cars that metaphorically went off the road.  He  complained that American cars don't sell in Japan -- which is true -- and then touched upon the trade deficit between the two countries ($69 billion).  Trump 's solution? The Japanese automobile industry should make their cars in the U.S.
âTry building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over. Thatâs not too much to ask ""  Trump  said. ""Is that rude to ask?â
UPDATE:  Trump 's complete remarks to Japan's automakers  found below  show that the U.S. President is fully aware of this fact.
But  Trump  has made statements about the Japanese auto industry that were off-base and damaging before. This January  Toyota shares temporarily lost nearly $1.2 billion in value after  Trump  tweeted that  he  wouldn't let them move their factories to Mexico.

5012,Trump's bun,Donald Trump,"(CNN) On the campaign trail   President Donald Trump 's typical McDonald's meal contained nearly a day's worth of calories and sodium  almost double the recommended daily dose of saturated fat and 2Â½ times the sugar he should eat in a day  according to US Dietary Guidelines.
 Trump  became well-known for  his  love of fast food during the 2016 election.  He  even tweeted a photo from  his  plane  ready to dive into a big bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken  but there are new details about  his  go-to meal at  his  other fast food favorite  McDonald's.
Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski wrote about it in his book about the campaign  saying  Trump  would order two Big Macs  two Filet-o-Fish sandwiches and a chocolate milkshake.
Drayer said that based on the protein and saturated fat in all those sandwiches   Trump  would be better off eating one of the Big Macs or one of the Filet-o-Fishes rather than two of either  even without the bun. And if  he  had a medium chocolate shake  that alone is 2Â½ times the recommended daily amount of sugar.
But at 71 years of age  a steady fast-food diet could compromise his health.

5014,How Trump And Race Are Splitting Evangelicals,Donald Trump,"The Rev. Billy Graham  the pastor and evangelical leader who died last week and is being laid to rest in Charlotte on Friday  built relationships across party lines  illustrated by the praise Presidents Bill Clinton  George W. Bush  Barack Obama and  Donald Trump  delivered after his death. But it likely will be hard for an evangelical Christian figure in this era to get the kind of bipartisan acclaim that Graham received in life and in death.
Americaâs community of self-described evangelicals  about a fourth of the population  is increasingly divided between a more conservative  Trump-aligned bloc deeply worried about losing the so-called culture wars; and a bloc that is more liberal on issues like immigration  conscious of the need to appeal to nonwhite Christians and wary of the president. The split in evangelical Christianity isnât new  but it appears to be widening under  Trump .
Now in office  conservative Christian leaders are strongly backing the president  even at times when almost no one else will. Jerry Falwell Jr.  the president of evangelical Liberty University  defended Trumpâs controversial comments in the wake of the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville  Virginia. Amid allegations that  Trump  had an extramarital affair  Franklin Graham  Billy Grahamâs son and head of the non-profit Samaritanâs Purse  downplayed the controversy.
In a recent New York Times op-ed  David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network cast  Trump  as Godâs gift to evangelical Christians  arguing  âThe Bible is replete with examples of flawed individuals being used to accomplish Godâs will.â Congressional Republicans often defend the president  but few compare him to biblical figures.
Why are influential figures in the white evangelical community so willing to align themselves with  Trump ? Well  first of all   Trump  remains popular with white evangelical voters. A Pew survey from December found that 61 percent of white evangelicals approved of Trumpâs job performance  compared to 32 percent of voters overall. (This was a substantial decline from  Trumpâs  78 percent approval among white evangelicals in February 2017  but they are are still one of the most pro-Trump blocs in the electorate.)
Secondly  on policy issues that some white evangelical leaders and activists care passionately about   Trump  has delivered.  He  has embraced the GOP effort to block any federal dollars from going to Planned Parenthood  signed into law a provision that makes it easier for states to keep their funds from being used at Planned Parenthood clinics  reversed an Obama administration policy that directed schools to allow transgender students to use the restroom of whichever gender they identify with and backed a push to allow ministers to formally endorse candidates without the risk of losing their tax-exempt status.
âConservative evangelicals will acknowledge that  Trump  has problems  but  he âs moving forward policy on the issues they care about  and in a sense thatâs all that matters for them â said Richard Flory  a University of Southern California sociologist focusing on religion. â Trump  is helping with conservative evangelicalsâ broader goal of keeping America an essentially Christian nation  with the moral values that white Christians support.â
Broadly  Trump and his administration have aligned with conservative Christians who argue that their traditional values on issues like gay rights are ignored in an increasingly liberal culture. âGeorge W. Bush was the evangelical candidate in 2000: He pushed traditional conservative policies  but he doesnât come close to  Mr. Trumpâs  courageous blunt strokes in defense of evangelicals â wrote Brody.  Trump  âeasily wins the unofficial label of âmost evangelical-friendly United States president ever.ââ
Brody may have an argument â but only if you limit your definition of evangelicals to the traditionally Republican  mostly non-Hispanic white camp. Since  Trump  has been in office  many prominent evangelical leaders  white and nonwhite  have criticized  his  cutbacks in the number of refugees allowed to enter the U.S.  the presidentâs alleged derogatory comments about immigrants from âshithole countriesâ and  his  decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  which protected âDreamers â or undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children  from deportation.
During the 2016 campaign  many high-profile evangelical pastors kept their distance from the candidate. In one case  it was reported during the campaign that Joel Osteen  who runs a megachurch in the Houston area with nationally broadcast services  was endorsing  Trump . In response  the pastor put out a statement declaring that was not true  adhering to his pattern of keeping a low-profile on political issues.
Itâs not that differences among evangelical leaders didnât exist before  but they seem more evident with  Trump  in the White House. And the demographic changes only exacerbate them. On immigration policy in particular â an issue that Falwell and Franklin Graham have not publicly disputed  Trump  on â the sizable nonwhite segment of the evangelical community has obvious implications.
âEvangelicals are very concerned about this  especially because so many evangelical congregations have Dreamers as part of our churches â Russell Moore  a leader in the Southern Baptist Convention  told USA Today recently in explaining why he and other evangelicals were pressing  Trump  to resolve the DACA issue.
For leaders who are focused on evangelism â that is  bringing more people to evangelical Christianity and keeping them engaged â embracing  Trump  and  his  controversial stances on immigration could actually be something of a liability. In contrast  several of  Trumpâs  strongest defenders in the evangelical community  like Falwell and Graham  donât run actual churches.","The Rev.

He  has embraced the GOP effort to block any federal dollars from going to Planned Parenthood  signed into law a provision that makes it easier for states to keep their funds from being used at Planned Parenthood clinics  reversed an Obama administration policy that directed schools to allow transgender students to use the restroom of whichever gender they identify with and backed a push to allow ministers to formally endorse candidates without the risk of losing their tax-exempt status.
âConservative evangelicals will acknowledge that  Trump  has problems  but  he âs moving forward policy on the issues they care about  and in a sense thatâs all that matters for them â said Richard Flory  a University of Southern California sociologist focusing on religion. â Trump  is helping with conservative evangelicalsâ broader goal of keeping America an essentially Christian nation  with the moral values that white Christians support.â
Broadly  Trump and his administration have aligned with conservative Christians who argue that their traditional values on issues like gay rights are ignored in an increasingly liberal culture. âGeorge W. Bush was the evangelical candidate in 2000: He pushed traditional conservative policies  but he doesnât come close to  Mr. Trumpâs  courageous blunt strokes in defense of evangelicals â wrote Brody.  Trump  âeasily wins the unofficial label of âmost evangelical-friendly United States president ever.ââ
Brody may have an argument â but only if you limit your definition of evangelicals to the traditionally Republican  mostly non-Hispanic white camp. Since  Trump  has been in office  many prominent evangelical leaders  white and nonwhite  have criticized  his  cutbacks in the number of refugees allowed to enter the U.S.  the presidentâs alleged derogatory comments about immigrants from âshithole countriesâ and  his  decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  which protected âDreamers â or undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children  from deportation.
During the 2016 campaign  many high-profile evangelical pastors kept their distance from the candidate. In one case  it was reported during the campaign that Joel Osteen  who runs a megachurch in the Houston area with nationally broadcast services  was endorsing  Trump . In response  the pastor put out a statement declaring that was not true  adhering to his pattern of keeping a low-profile on political issues.
Itâs not that differences among evangelical leaders didnât exist before  but they seem more evident with  Trump  in the White House. And the demographic changes only exacerbate them. On immigration policy in particular â an issue that Falwell and Franklin Graham have not publicly disputed  Trump  on â the sizable nonwhite segment of the evangelical community has obvious implications.
âEvangelicals are very concerned about this  especially because so many evangelical congregations have Dreamers as part of our churches â Russell Moore  a leader in the Southern Baptist Convention  told USA Today recently in explaining why he and other evangelicals were pressing  Trump  to resolve the DACA issue.
For leaders who are focused on evangelism â that is  bringing more people to evangelical Christianity and keeping them engaged â embracing  Trump  and  his  controversial stances on immigration could actually be something of a liability. In contrast  several of  Trumpâs  strongest defenders in the evangelical community  like Falwell and Graham  donât run actual churches.",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,,,

5020,In Letter to Trump Faust Urges Continuation of DACA,Donald Trump,"As President Donald Trump considers ending a program that allows some undocumented students to legally live in the United States  University President Drew G. Faust implored him in a letter Monday to preserve it.
But DACA stands on shaky ground under Trump  who pledged to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign. The  Trump  administration extended the program in June  to the relief of Harvardâs undocumented students. In recent days  however  reports have indicated that  Trump  is once again mulling DACAâs future  under pressure from 10 states that have threatened to sue the federal government if it doesnât put a stop to the program by Sept. 5. Options on the table include doing away with DACA entirely or putting in place a watered-down version of the program  according to a CNN report.
This letter is the second Faust has sent to  Trump  about DACA; she and more than 100 college and university presidents co-signed a statement in support of the program to  Trump  last November.
Tanaka praised administrators for their âproactiveâ effortsâincluding Faustâs letter to  Trump âbut criticized Faustâs reluctance to call Harvard a sanctuary campus.
Both Tanaka and Pinto said they hope that if  Trump  does put a halt to the DACA program  Faust and other administrators will ramp up protections for undocumented students.","As President  [TGT]  considers ending a program that allows some undocumented students to legally live in the United States  University President Drew G.

Photo by Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images
Last week   President Donald Trump  announced that the United States now recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and will soon move its embassy to that city from Tel Aviv. This stance has been implicite US policy since Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act in 1995  and Israel has long had control of the city  and kept most of its government facilities there. But because Palestinians claim Eastern Jerusalem as their capital  and Arabs and Muslims the world over generally view the status of the city as a touchstone issue  most countries do not recognize the full city as Israelâs capital. Likewise  the last three American presidential administrations have quietly delayed moving the embassy there.
Trumpâs proclamation didnât change anything on the ground. That same day  in fact   he  quietly signed a memo delaying official action on the embassy for at least six months  and probably longer. But  his  abstract recognition of Israeli control of the city and brash statement of intent read as a clear signal that the administration may not respect the Palestinian quest for sovereignty. And as anyone with a modicum of knowledge about the region might have predicted  it sparked a wave of protests across the world resulting in many injuries and at least four reported deaths in Palestine.
To gauge how seriously we should be concerned about elevated terrorist threats in the wake of  Trump âs decision  VICE spoke to Thomas Sanderson  an expert on terrorism and terrorist threats at the Center for Strategic and International Studies with almost two decades of experience. Hereâs what we talked about.
VICE: When you first heard  Trump  was going to make this announcement  what did you see as the most immediate outcome?
I think the president made the declaration for short-term political gain  knowing the long-term execution of this policy would be so far down the road that the cost of making the declaration would not be too sharp at this point. There is a cost to it  the further tarnishing of the US reputation. But  Trump  knows thatâs many years off  and could be reversed by the next president.","Left Image: (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images).

5027,Trump calls for ending visa program after N.Y. attack blasts Democrats,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday seized on the deadly New York City truck attack to step up demands for stricter U.S. immigration laws  asking Congress to end a visa program that let the Uzbek suspect into the country and saying  he  might send  him  to Guantanamo Bay.

In a day of harsh recriminations over Tuesdayâs attack that killed eight people in Americaâs largest city   Trump  appeared to assign some blame for an incident that authorities have labeled as terrorism to top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer  who accused  Trump  of politicizing a national tragedy.
 Trump  said  he  would consider sending the suspect  identified by authorities as Sayfullo Saipov  to the military prison at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  which  his  Democratic predecessor Barack Obama tried but failed to shut. No detainee has been sent to the Guantanamo prison since 2008.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters that  Trump  considers Saipov an âenemy combatant â a designation that would curtail his legal rights.  Trump  called the suspect âthis animalâ and lambasted the U.S. justice system for terrorism suspects as âa jokeâ and âa laughingstock.â
Since taking office in January   Trump  has sought to increase deportations of illegal immigrations and limit legal immigration.
 Trump  reprised what has been  his  stance as a White House candidate and as president - that tougher immigration laws should be a first line of defense against such attacks.
âIâm going to ask Congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program â  Trump  told reporters at the White House.
âWe have to get much tougher â  he  said. âWe have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct. Weâre so politically correct that weâre afraid to do anything.â
âThe terrorist came into our country through what is called the âDiversity Visa Lottery Program â a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based â  Trump  wrote on Twitter.
Sanders said later that  Trump  does not blame Schumer for the attack and would âloveâ to work with the senator on tougher immigration laws.
 Trump  on Wednesday also renewed  his  call for a âmerit-basedâ visa system - which would favor the highly skilled - and for ending âchain migration â which allows legal immigrants to apply for relatives abroad to come to the United States.  Trump  said there were â23 people that came in or potentially came inâ with Saipov.
 Trump  accused congressional Democrats of blocking immigration legislation that would make the nation safer.
âWe have a lot of good bills in there. Weâre being stopped by Democrats because theyâre obstructionists. And honestly  they donât want to do whatâs right for our country â  Trump  said.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the  Trump  administration for not declaring Saipov  who remained hospitalized after being shot in the abdomen by a police officer on Tuesday  as an âenemy combatant.â
As a presidential candidate   Trump  called for a total ban on Muslims entering the country as a counter-terrorism measure.","[TGT]  seized on the deadly New York City truck attack to step up demands for stricter U.S. immigration laws  asking Congress to end a visa program that let the Uzbek suspect into the country and saying   [TGT]   might send   [TGT]   to Guantanamo Bay.

5028,Levin: Good to know where liberals finally draw a line; Sekulow speaks out about scandals that need investigation,Donald Trump,"SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS  DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think that the president has been attacked mercilessly on personal accounts by members on that program. And I think he's been very clear that when he gets attacked  he's going to hit back. I think the American people elected somebody who's tough  who's smart  and who's a fighter. And that's  Donald Trump . And I don't think that it's a surprise to anybody that he fights fire with fire.
HANNITY: Now  I personally would ignore this unhinged duo  if you will  that calls the president a schmuck  a liar and worse on a daily basis and has pretty much an emotional breakdown a day. Now  the White House here does have a point. And look  we're not defending personal attacks  but here is the simple basic truth. NBC so-called news and the rest of the destroy  Trump  media -- they're not innocent victims that they're claiming to be here.
And tonight -- and this is something you're only going to see right here on ""Hannity"" -- we will show you how the liberal leftist propaganda media has been carrying out what is a relentless campaign to undermine  delegitimize  smear  slander and destroy  President Trump . This war was started by the mainstream media  not by the president.
Let's take a look. At the side of your screen  remember  WikiLeaks -- they exposed what many of us already knew and thought was going on for a long time  and that is the destroy  Trump  media was caught openly colluding  supporting  trying to elect Hillary Clinton  helping  her  campaign! Now  these rigid left-wing ideologues -- they all wanted Hillary Clinton to win. They did everything they could possibly do to try and make that happen.
Now  imagine for a second the press giving  Donald Trump   any Republican  any conservative this type of treatment. Now  by leaking debate questions like CNN did or allowing stories and quotes to be edited before they go out -- now  the list of examples goes on and on.
And aside from the colluding with Clinton  the media openly mocked  ridiculed the idea that  Donald Trump  could ever become the president of the United States. ""Ha  ha! No  that could never happen!"" Really? They were wrong. Watch.
SETH MEYERS  WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER  APRIL 30  2011:  Donald Trump  has been saying that  he  will run for president as a Republican  which is surprising since I just assumed  he  was running as a joke.
REP. KEITH ELLISON  D-MINN.  ""THIS WEEK""/ABC  JULY 26  2016: Now  we better be ready for the fact that  he  might be leading the Republican ticket.
And you remember on election night  November the 8th   Donald Trump  --  he  won the White House. It was a funeral for the mainstream media  obviously distraught and depressed and couldn't wrap their arms around what just happened. After all  they were pulling for Hillary to win. They thought she'd win! Remember this?
HANNITY: These people are just total crackpots! They're unhinged  suffering from  Trump  derangement syndrome. And the way -- by the way -- by the way  aside from Mr. thrill up his leg  Chris Matthews  has anyone else in the destroy  Trump  media admitted that there's no evidence when it comes to Russia-Trump collusion? Not really. They're still pushing it day and night  night and day. They're  like  hoping publicly that it comes true.

5032,Trump vows to campaign intensively for Republicans but may avoid the primaries,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  said on Wednesday that  he  plans to devote much of  his  time this year to helping Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Congress  but suggested  he  may stay out of divisive intra-party primary fights.
""I am going to spend probably four or five days a week helping people because we need more Republicans ""  the Republican president  said in an interview with Reuters. ""To get the real agenda through  we need more Republicans.""
 Trump  indicated  he  would avoid endorsing candidates in Republican primaries  as  he  did last year in Alabama's Senate race  when the incumbent  he  endorsed was defeated by a hard-line conservative challenger  and would likely focus on the November general election in which Democrats are trying to wrest control of Congress from the Republicans.
""It's hard sometimes. Sometimes you really like three candidates â that's a very tough position to be in. But we have places where I like all of the candidates ""  Trump  said. ""But I will be very much involved with â beyond the primaries â with the election itself  very very much.""
 Trump  is scheduled to travel to western Pennsylvania on Thursday in support of Rick Saccone  the Republican candidate in a special election to replace Republican U.S. Representative Tim Murphy  who resigned in October amid a sex scandal.
 Trump  said  he  is traveling to Pennsylvania to give Saccone  his  ""total support.""
Fractious Republican primary battles already are developing in states including Arizona  Nevada and Wisconsin  where some of the candidates are backed by Steve Bannon   Trump 's former chief political strategist who he fired last August.

5036,Trump to head to Pennsylvania to tout tax cuts promote GOP candidate,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  will head to Pennsylvania to support the Republican candidate in a special election there.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After a disastrous loss for Republicans in Alabama last month   President Donald Trump  will again wade into congressional politics on Thursday when  he  travels to western Pennsylvania to signal support for the Republican candidate in a special election there.
While  Trump  will tour an industrial equipment company outside of Pittsburgh to tout the tax-reform legislation passed by Congress last month  the visit comes amid a contest to replace Representative Tim Murphy  who resigned in October amid a sex scandal.
 The president  will be met on arrival by Rick Saccone  a state representative and the Republican candidate to replace Murphy in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Democratic candidate in the March 13 election is Conor Lamb  a Marine veteran and former U.S. attorney.
 Trump  won the district by nearly 20 points in the November 2016 presidential election and surprised political observers by winning Pennsylvania  traditionally a Democratic-leaning state  by less than 1 percent.
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday   Trump  pledged to be heavily involved in the yearâs congressional races  including the one to replace Murphy.
In a special U.S. Senate election in Alabama late last year  the president first backed the incumbent candidate in the Republican primary  Luther Strange  who had been named temporarily to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when  Trump  named him U.S. attorney general.
After Strange lost to Roy Moore   Trump  switched his support to Moore. The president stood by him even after Moore was accused of sexual misconduct - allegations that the Republican candidate denied.
Moore lost to Democrat Doug Jones in the general election  a shocking result in deeply conservative Alabama and shaving Republicans' majority in the Senate to 51-49. Exit polls showed that many voters turned out to register their disapproval of  Trump .

After being sworn in on Jan. 20  2017  President Donald Trump and his team never strayed far from the headlines.
3. June 1:  Trump  withdraws from Paris climate agreement
 Trump  announced  he  would pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement.
The decision fulfilled a key promise  Trump  made on the campaign trail and overturned a major accomplishment of  his  predecessor  Barack Obama.
About an hour after the vote was announced   President Donald Trump   tweeted  ""3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning  let ObamaCare implode  then deal. Watch!""
 Trump  was criticized for  his  initial response to violent protests stemming from a planned rally against the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville  Virginia  but  his  response to the criticism made matters worse.
When asked about  his  immediate response   Trump  blamed âboth sidesâ for the conflict  adding that there were ""very fine people"" among both the protesters â which included white supremacists and white nationalists â and the counterprotesters.
""I think there is blame on both sides. You look at both sides. I think there is blame on both sides ""  Trump  said.
The promise to ""build the wall"" became a campaign slogan for  Trump  and was regularly chanted at  his  campaign.
8. Sept 19:  Trump  threatens to 'totally destroy' North Korea at UN
In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly   Trump  used the platform to slam North Korean leader ""Rocket Man"" Kim Jong Un.

""The United States has great strength and patience  but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies  we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.  Rocket Man  is on a suicide mission for  himself  and for  his  regime. The United States is ready  willing and able  but hopefully this will not be necessary  "" Trump  said.
A number of squabbles have cropped up between  Trump  and members of  his  own party over the course of the past 12 months  but they appeared to reach a tipping point in late-October with Sen. Bob Corker  R-Tenn.
 Trump  and Corker  the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  an ally of Trumpâs during the election  had been having a war of words for weeks.

WASHINGTON â  President Donald Trump  ripped into one of  his  favorite targets Thursday in Beijing: The United States' ""shockingly"" large trade deficit with China.
""I blame past administrations  "" Trump  declared  ""for allowing this out-of-control deficit to take place and grow.""
America's lopsided trade relationship with China and with the rest of the world is a familiar theme for  Trump  and  his  economic team. They've branded trade deficits a mark of economic weakness â even shame â that depress growth and kill jobs.

5042,White and male: broader bureaucracy mirrors Trump cabinet's profile,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When  Donald Trump  faced criticism from advocacy groups for not including more women and minorities in  his  cabinet last January  the incoming administration promised that the lower rungs of the bureaucracy would ultimately look more diverse.
Now  recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make-up of the broader  Trump  administration shows that with over 1 000 mid-level political jobs filled by mid-year the appointees look much like the top leadership: mostly white and male.
Out of the  Trump  administrationâs 24 top cabinet-level positions  17 are filled by white men.
Asked to comment on the mid-level personnel data  White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said  Trump  had a long history of promoting women and pointed to last weekâs nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen to lead the Department of Homeland Security.
â He  will continue to elevate and empower women to top posts in  his  administration â Walters said. She declined to discuss  Trump âs views on the ethnicity of political appointees.
One day before  Trump  took office on Jan. 20  his then-spokesman Sean Spicer responded to criticism of the cabinetâs lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity.
âPeople (will) look at and respect the level of diversity throughout  his  entire administration â  he  told reporters.

5043,Exclusive: Canada increasingly convinced Trump will pull out of NAFTA,Trump,"LONDON  Ontario (Reuters) - Canada is increasingly convinced that  President Donald Trump  will soon announce the United States intends to pull out of NAFTA  two government sources said on Wednesday  sending the Canadian and Mexican currencies lower and hurting stocks.
The comments cast further doubt on prospects for talks to modernize the trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  which  Trump  has repeatedly threatened to abandon unless major changes are made.
It is not certain the United States would quit NAFTA even if  Trump  gave the required six monthsâ notice  since  he  is not obliged to act once the deadline runs out. Notice of withdrawal could also raise opposition in Congress.
One of the Canadian government sources also said later it was not certain that  Trump  would move against the treaty and that Ottawa was prepared for many scenarios.
âThe government is increasingly sure about this ... it is now planning for  Trump  to announce a withdrawal â one of the sources  who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation  said.
Separately  a U.S. source close to the White House quoted  Trump  as saying âI want outâ as the talks drag on with little sign of progress.
 Trump  has long called the 1994 treaty a bad deal that hurts American workers.  His  negotiating team has set proposals that have alarmed their Canadian and Mexican counterparts.
Scott Minerd  Global Chief Investment Officer at Guggenheim Partners  said âif  Trump  were to announce a NAFTA exit  the stock market would probably pull back by 5 percent or so before advancing to new highs. Most likely the Canadians are reacting to the Presidentâs negotiating posture.â
The Canadian sources said that if  Trump  did announce the United States was pulling out  Canada would stay at the table  since the talks would continue at a lower level. Mexico has previously said it would walk away if  Trump  formally announced Washington intended to quit.
Canadian officials say if  Trump  does announce a U.S. withdrawal   it  could be a negotiating tactic designed to win concessions.

5044,Democrats prepared to redact memo,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON â Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee are prepared to black out parts of their memo about the FBI's Russia investigation to ensure there's no harmful spilling of secrets  then try again to get  President Donald Trump  to let it come out. A White House aide said he's confident it will be released once Democrats ""clean it up.""
Rep. Adam Schiff of California  senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee  said  Trump  is putting his personal interest above the country's in blocking a memo that ""completely undermines his claim of vindication"" in special counsel Robert Mueller's continuing investigation of the 2016  Trump  campaign's relationship with Russian interests and Russia's meddling in the election. "" The president  doesn't want the public to see the underlying facts "" Schiff said Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""
The White House legislative director  Marc Short  countered that Democrats padded their memo with sensitive information  knowing  Trump  would stop  its  release  in an effort to make him look obstructionist.
 Trump  overrode strong Justice Department objections when  he  declassified a Republican memo alleging an abuse of surveillance powers in the FBI's Russia investigation. The FBI expressed ""grave concerns"" about the memo's accuracy and the Justice Department said in advance that its release  without proper review  would be ""extraordinarily reckless.""
But  Trump  has blocked the Democratic document  which tries to counter the Republican allegations of surveillance excesses.  The president  has the authority to keep such information under wraps  and exercised it only against the Democrats.

The money would be distributed through new types of programs that are designed to generate greater state and local government and private sector spending.

 Trump  repeatedly asserted that  his  campaign didn't collude with anyone to win the 2016 election  but  his  reference to Wednesday's massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  in a bid to prop up his no-collusion-case  stood out.
""Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable ""  Trump  wrote.

5048,Blaming Democrats  Trump Says 'DACA Is Probably Dead' : NPR,Trump,"Blaming Democrats   Trump Says 'DACA  Is Probably Dead'
Hours after the U.S. government announced it would again begin processing renewal applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals due to a federal court order   President Trump  claimed that the program â which has granted a temporary legal reprieve to people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children â was ""probably dead.""
The furor  Trump  ignited with  his  reported use of a vulgarity about African nations in a meeting with lawmakers last week about  DACA  consumed the Sunday talk shows just days before the federal government is due to shut down absent a fresh congressional spending bill.
 Trump  sought to focus the blame for any lack of progress on  DACA  on Democrats  tweeting:  ""DACA  is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want  it   they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.""
As NPR and other outlets reported last week  it was  Trump  who rejected a tentative agreement reached by a small  bipartisan group of senators that would have allowed  DACA  recipients permanent residency in the U.S. and a path to citizenship. During a meeting with the lawmakers   Trump  reportedly called African nations ""shithole countries"" and questioned why the U.S. didn't favor letting more immigrants in from nations like Norway instead of countries like Haiti.
Two of  Trump 's congressional allies who were present at that meeting sought to push a different version of events during appearances on the Sunday talk shows.
On ABC's ""This Week"" Sen. David Perdue  R-Ga.  said  Trump   ""did not use that word "" and that multiple media accounts of the meeting were a ""gross misrepresentation."" Perdue's comments were a shift. In an interview on Friday  Perdue had said he didn't remember the president using such language. ""I didn't hear that word either "" said Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton in an interview on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" with host John Dickerson.
On Sunday evening   Trump  was pressed on the issue upon arriving at  his  West Palm Beach golf resort where  he  was to have dinner with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy.
 Trump  said the derogatory comments attributed to  him  last week never happened. ""Did you see what various senators in the room said about my comments? They were not made ""  he  told the press pool.
Asked about charges of racism for his alleged slur   Trump  said: ""I'm not a racist. I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed.""
Regarding DACA  the president reiterated that he was working toward a deal  but that Democrats were not helping. ""Honestly  I don't think the Democrats want to make a deal "" he told reporters at the Trump International Golf Course. ""We have a lot of sticking points  but they are all Democrat sticking points.""
 Trump  said  he  hoped there wouldn't be a government shutdown. ""I don't know if there is going to be a shutdown ""  he  said. ""There shouldn't be because if there is our military gets hurt very badly. We cannot let our military be hurt.""
 President Trump  ordered an end to the program in September and gave lawmakers until March of this year to come up with a legislative fix. Last week  a federal court in California issued a nationwide injunction blocking the  Trump  administration's decision.
In another tweet Sunday   Trump  said  he  wants people coming to the country ""based on merit.""  He  said:

5049,Trump has an Iran strategy but it's going to be difficult to pull off,Trump,"The Trump administration  is sending mixed signals to supporters and opponents of the Iran nuclear deal.
 The Trump administration 's game plan for Iran has a certain logic to  it   but executing  it  will be the most difficult diplomatic gambit his team has attempted thus far.
 The administration  is attempting to signal to supporters of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)  the nuclear agreement US President Barack Obama negotiated with Iran  that  President Donald Trump  is willing to blow up that deal because  he  sees it as disadvantageous to the United States  while also signaling that  the president  is willing to not blow up the deal  provided that  he  gets  his  way on other elements of a counter-Iran strategy.
At the same time   the administration  is attempting to signal to opponents of the JCPOA that there is a way to address the weaknesses in the deal without blowing it up  provided that those opponents give  the president  some relief by revising the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA) to remove the 90-day certification requirement.
In its most basic form  this is a boat-rocking strategy.  Trump  is threatening to do something that most people do not want  him  to do â including  apparently  most people on  the president 's own team â in order to get others to do things that they have hitherto been unwilling to do. (By the way  this strategy is not unlike the strategy that the  Trump  team is currently pursuing on North Korea â only there  the primary target of the boat-rocking is the Chinese government  and here the primary target is European allies and Democrats on Capitol Hill.)
And in practice  Obama was hesitant to challenge Iran on those other activities lest doing so would disrupt the diplomatic gains of the JCPOA  whereas  Trump  has received little support from our allies when he showed greater willingness to confront Iran.
When combined with the unwillingness of our allies to do more to push Iran on non-nuclear issues  the 90-day requirement that the president publicly certify that Iran is abiding by the JCPOA agreement was a pill too bitter for  Trump  to swallow more than twice.
The  Trump  administration is betting that Congress will not do so because  in the interval  the White House is hoping to persuade our allies to get tougher on Iran on the non-nuclear issues. In exchange for that greater allied cooperation  the administration hopes it will be able to persuade Congress to amend the INARA and remove the 90-day certification  thus buying more time for other lines of pressure to come to bear on Iran.
The foregoing is based on the advanced reporting on what the Trump administration is planning to do  along with a heavy dose of rational actor rationalization (""What is the best way to make sense of the confusing signals coming out of the administration?""). If I have read the tea leaves correctly  the Trump team has a strategy  albeit a strategy that is very difficult to pull off successfully.
It will also require deft and sustained diplomatic pressure on our allies  simultaneously cajoling them out of their post-JCPOA complacency and reassuring them that going along with the Trump administration is not a one-way ticket to what they would consider to be the worst of all possible outcomes: a violent confrontation with an Iran that can put the collapse of the JCPOA on us.","[TGT] is sending mixed signals to supporters and opponents of the Iran nuclear deal.

When combined with the unwillingness of our allies to do more to push Iran on non-nuclear issues  the 90-day requirement that the president publicly certify that Iran is abiding by the JCPOA agreement was a pill too bitter for   [TGT]   to swallow more than twice.
 [TGT]  is betting that Congress will not do so because  in the interval  the White House is hoping to persuade our allies to get tougher on Iran on the non-nuclear issues. In exchange for that greater allied cooperation   [TGT]  hopes it will be able to persuade Congress to amend the INARA and remove the 90-day certification  thus buying more time for other lines of pressure to come to bear on Iran.
The foregoing is based on the advanced reporting on what  [TGT]  is planning to do  along with a heavy dose of rational actor rationalization (""What is the best way to make sense of the confusing signals coming out of  [TGT] ?""). If I have read the tea leaves correctly   [TGT]  has a strategy  albeit a strategy that is very difficult to pull off successfully.
 [TGT]  will also require deft and sustained diplomatic pressure on our allies  simultaneously cajoling them out of their post-JCPOA complacency and reassuring them that going along with  [TGT]  is not a one-way ticket to what they would consider to be the worst of all possible outcomes: a violent confrontation with an Iran that can put the collapse of the JCPOA on us.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Negative,,,,,,

""So if we could make a temporary deal  because ultimately we're going to have it back to the states  we're going to block-grant back to the states  but if we made a temporary deal  I think it would be a great thing for people.

 Trump  was referring to Republican plans to convert some open-ended federal funding for Obamacare and Medicaid into a fixed amount that would be sent to states as block grants.

5051,Law enforcement officials warily eye White House as Trump criticizes FBI,Trump,"FBI Director Christopher A. Wray sent a staff-wide message Monday in the wake of fresh criticism from  President Trump   telling employees to keep focused on their mission and praising them for âexample after exampleââ of their professionalism.
On Saturday  The Washington Post and the New York Times reported that Peter Strzok  a senior counterintelligence official who played a key role in investigating both the Hillary Clinton email case and possible connections between the  Trump  campaign and the Kremlin  had been removed from his job on the special counselâs probe because of texts he exchanged with another senior FBI official.

Mueller is probing whether any  Trump  associates coordinated with Russian agents to try to interfere in the 2016 presidential race  and whether the president or other White House officials sought to obstruct justice in trying to end that investigation  according to people familiar with the matter. The president has long maintained he did nothing wrong  and he has called the probe a political witch hunt  saying it is Clinton  not him  who should be investigated. White House aides have repeatedly said Muellerâs probe will end soon  even though people close to the investigation have said it will last many more months  and possibly years.
The conduct by Strzok and the FBI official  a lawyer named Lisa Page  is now being investigated by the Justice Departmentâs inspector general. People familiar with the texts described the communications as disparaging of  Trump  and generally supportive of Clinton  although one of those individuals â a friend of Page â insisted the whole issue was âoverblown.ââ

5053,Obama Not Embarrassed by His Scandals?,Barack Obama,"When  Barack Obama  spoke at the 12th annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston  MA  many of us scratched our heads as to why the event was off-the-record. No photography  recording  or social media posting about Obamaâs appearance was allowed. Obviously  he would not be talking about golf. But  with over 3 500 people in attendance  there was no way this speech would be hidden for long. As expected  a recording of Obamaâs appearance was leaked.
 Obama  said a lot of things over the course of an hour  but Iâd like to focus on  his  claim that  while some people in  his  administration made mistakes  âWe didn't have a scandal that embarrassed us.â This was not the first time  Obama  claimed  his  administration was devoid of scandal. Before leaving office  he  claimed  his  administration was ""probably"" the first âin modern history that hasnât had a major scandal in the White House.â Others in  his  administration have echoed this âscandal-freeâ narrative like a coordinated chorus hoping  after repeating it often enough  the people would believe it was true. The sad thing is  many people do believe it.
Obamaâs claims always come with a subtle caveat.  His  administration didnât have âa scandal that embarrassed us â or they didnât have âa major scandal.â But  my favorite nuance from  his  super-secret appearance in Boston was when  he  said  ""Generally speaking  you didn't hear about a lot of drama inside our White House.""  He âs right about that point. As I document in my forthcoming book  The Scandalous Presidency of Barack Obama  there were over two dozen scandals over the course of Obamaâs presidency  and they were all downplayed or ignored by the mainstream media.
Soon after  Obama  was elected  his presidential transition got caught up in a scandal surrounding the attempted illegal âsaleâ of his former Senate seat by former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich  who wanted to profit from what he called âa [expletive] valuable thing.â  Obama  denied having any involvement in discussions about who might be appointed to replace him  yet he had a wish list of replacements that even included his advisor Valerie Jarrettâwhom Blagojevich was willing to nominate in exchange for his being appointed to Obamaâs cabinet.
 Obama  also met with Blagojevich to discuss his Senate seat in a meeting about which a local CBS affiliate published two stories  only to remove both off their website after the scandal broke. This scandal could have undone the  Obama  presidency before it even started  but after  Obamaâs  historic victory  that was the last thing the media would do  a trend that would continue throughout his presidency.
The media protected  Obama  from criticism and controversy as aggressively as the Secret Service protected him from danger. But that doesnât change the fact that Obamaâs presidency was the most scandalous in history.  Obama  may not be embarrassed by Fast and Furious  Benghazi  the IRS scandal  the VA scandal  Solyndra  the OPM hacking scandal  the GSA scandal  the Iran Ransom scandal  Uranium One  or the FISA abuse scandal currently being unraveled  but he should be. And the media should be embarrassed at how they failed the American public by pretending these scandals didnât exist  or werenât important.
 Obama  has now been out of office for more than a year and weâre still learning dirty details about his presidency. In December of last year  Politico published the bombshell report about how the  Obama  administration stonewalled an investigation of an international drug-trafficking operation of the Iran-backed terror group Hezbollah in order to protect his nuclear deal with Iran. The media outright ignored the story. ABC  CBS  and NBC considered this scandal unworthy of coverage. The Mueller investigation has exposed more about how politicized the Department of Justice became under  Obama  than it has exposed any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians  not that the media has taken any interest in that.
Despite a presidency more corrupt than Richard Nixon  many in the media had the gall to claim  upon Obamaâs leaving office  he had a âscandal-free presidency.â Paul Blumenthal claimed at The Huffington Post that while scandal âhas consumed the final four years of every two-term president in modern history [â¦] Barack Obamaâs administration is the exception.â David Brooks wrote in the New York Times  â Obama  administration has been remarkably scandal-free.â Such laughable claims have persisted  and many on the left still make and believe this claim. Back in September  liberal CNN commentator Bakari Sellers described  Obama  as âeight years scandal-free.â Trust me  there are many more shameful examples. So  when  Obama  says  ""Generally speaking  you didn't hear about a lot of drama inside our White House â  he  wants us to believe that if the media didnât report on it then it didnât happen.
When the media refuses to give us the full knowledge of the character and conduct of our rulers  we get  Barack Obama  for eight long years. The media presented  Obama  as a successful  scandal-free presidentâa massive cover-up unprecedented in the history of modern journalismâand this amounts to an abdication of their duty to the American people to tell us the truth. We expect the free press to serve as an important check on the government. Their failure to do so with  Obama  is  his  golden ticket to historical greatness and  he  clearly recognizes this and is using it to  his  advantage.
John Adams once wrote  ""Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people  who have a right [...] to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge  I mean  of the characters and conduct of their rulers."" The media denied us the knowledge of  Obamaâs  character and conduct and will continue to do so. If we donât shine the light on the facts of  Obama  and  his  presidency now  the myth of a âscandal-freeâ  Obama  administration will be written as fact for the history books.","When   [TGT] spoke at the 12th annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston  MA  many of us scratched our heads as to why the event was off-the-record.

5056,Trump unveils plan to stimulate infrastructure improvements,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump unveiled a long-awaited infrastructure plan on Monday that asks the U.S. Congress to authorize $200 billion over 10 years to stimulate $1.5 trillion in improvements paid for by states  localities and private investors.
In remarks at the White House   Trump  cited âthe critical need to rebuild Americaâs crumbling infrastructureâ and said  his  proposal would âspur the biggest and boldest infrastructure investment in American history.â
âOur roads are in bad shape â  Trump  said. âAnd weâre going to get the roads in great shape. And  very important  weâre going to make our infrastructure modernized. And weâre really way behind schedule. Weâre way behind other countries.â

 Trump  has made  his  infrastructure plan one of  his  top legislative priorities this year  ahead of the November mid-term congressional elections in which Democrats will try to take over control of Congress from  his  fellow Republicans.
Legislation for  Trump âs infrastructure proposal would need 60 votes for passage in the 100-seat Senate. But with Republicans holding only a 51-49 majority  they would need some Democratic support for passage. With strong Democratic opposition expected  the plan faces an uphill battle.
â Trump âs plan is just another giveaway to corporations and wealthy developers at the expense of American workers  and it fails to address some of the most pressing infrastructure needs our country faces â the Democratic National Committee said.

5059,Government Shutdown: Republicans Democrats Trade Blame As Senate Misses Midnight Deadline : NPR,Trump,"On Saturday morning  President Trump responded on Twitter  accusing Democrats of playing ""Shutdown politics.""
The apparent congressional paralysis risked overshadowing the first anniversary of  President Trump 's inauguration and capped off a year defined at times by chaos and frustration from both the White House and congressional Republicans despite their unified control of Washington.
But Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D-N.Y.  pushed to include an immigration measure that would include a pathway to citizenship for roughly 700 000 immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program the  Trump  administration rescinded last year. Democrats wanted a pathway to citizenship for those roughly 700 000 immigrants who were in the country illegally after being brought here as children.
 Trump  has canceled plans to travel to  his  Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the weekend  where  he  was set to have a gala fundraiser Saturday to commemorate  his  inauguration one year ago.
Just after midnight   McConnell  took the Senate floor to put fault on Democrats for not backing the House bill and averting a shutdown.
However  the hashtag #TrumpShutdown was also trending on Twitter late Friday night  and Democrats believe that it's Republicans who will end up shouldering the majority of blame from the public given the GOP controls both Congress and the White House.
 Trump  appeared to complicate efforts to reach a compromise over the past weeks  at first signaling  he  would sign any immigration deal but then rejecting a bipartisan proposal  bending to  his  conservative  hardline base and insisting any deal had to have funding for  his  trademark border wall. And negotiations further stalled after  Trump  reportedly used a vulgarity in questioning why the U.S. should welcome immigrants from Africa instead of places like Norway. ( Trump  has denied that  he  used that language.)
Schumer took to the Senate floor immediately after McConnell early Saturday and said that when he met with  Trump  at the White House Friday  he had even put the border wall on the negotiating table in order to reach a compromise on DACA. But ""even that was not enough to entice the president to finish the deal "" Schumer said  accusing  Trump  and Republicans of ""rooting for a shutdown"" which would ""crash entirely"" on the president's shoulders.
Polling released Friday from both Washington Post/ABC News and CNN found that most Americans would blame  Trump  and Republicans over Democrats in the event a shutdown occurred. However  CNN also found a majority said approving a budget deal was more important than finding a way to advance DACA.","On Saturday morning   [TGT]  responded on Twitter  accusing Democrats of playing ""Shutdown politics.""

5062,Trump says solar tariff will create âa lot of jobs.â But it could wipe out many more.,Trump,"President Trump  imposed tariffs on imported residential washing machines and solar powered products on Jan. 23. (The Washington Post)
â  President Trump   discussing a new tariff on solar-cell imports in remarks at the White House  Jan. 23  2018
 Trump  says a tariff on solar-energy cells and panels will create jobs and revive a U.S. manufacturing sector that has been decimated by imports.
The tariff sparked controversy in the solar industry after  Trump  imposed it Jan. 23. A couple of remaining U.S. solar-cell manufacturers say it will help them get back on their feet. But the developers that install solar panels and farms â a much larger segment of the industry â say it will hike their costs  kill projects and make it harder to compete with wind and natural gas.
But the tariff is bound to change the dynamics. Will it add âa lot of jobs â as  Trump  says?
Relying on a little-used section of trade law that lets him âsafeguardâ U.S. products being hammered by imports   Trump  imposed a tariff on solar cells and modules that starts at 30 percent in 2018. The tariff then drops to 25 percent in 2019; 20 percent in 2020; and 15 percent in  its  final year  2021. The first 2.5 gigawatts of imported solar cells are exempt from the tariff each year.
The tariff rates were set by the  Trump  administration  not the ITC  and announced by U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer on Jan. 23  along with another tariff on washing machines.
The Solar Energy Industries Association  a national trade group  also opposed a tariff in ITC testimony and estimated that 23 000 jobs would be lost in 2018 because of  Trumpâs  move.
Independent analysts at GTM Research estimated that  Trumpâs  tariff would cause an 11 percent decline in the amount of solar power capacity expected to be installed in the United States over five years  from 2018 to 2022. GTM analysts say  the tariff  will slow but not stop the growth in the solar industry.
The trade group said it took a previous study by IHS Markit on the potential effect of several different tariff rates and adjusted its figures to reflect Trumpâs final numbers. The National Renewable Energy Lab has developed a model for estimating how many jobs would be needed for solar installation projects. The Solar Energy Industries Association ran its numbers through that model to estimate how many jobs would be needed in total after accounting for the lower number of solar installations.
With that in mind  our next question was whether the tariff could start a boom in solar-cell manufacturing. After all  thatâs the part of the industry  Trump  is trying to help. And if  his  plan works  that could offset the losses on the installation and maintenance side of the industry.
For what itâs worth  the SEIA says that  by factoring in both employment gains and losses from  Trumpâs  tariff  manufacturing jobs overall in the solar industry would decline by 800 in 2018. Thatâs part of their analysis estimating a 23 000 net job loss in 2018.
In this case   Trump  says U.S.-based manufacturers will add âa lot of jobsâ because of a tariff he imposed on imported solar cells and modules. The homegrown industry for these products has been decimated by competitors in low-wage countries over the past decade  but thereâs no anecdotal evidence or research that indicates  Trumpâs  tariff will bring about an American renewal.
Instead  independent analysts  solar industry leaders and the industryâs national trade association say the tariff will price solar installation companies out of the game in places where their projects could be competing with wind or natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimated that 23 000 net jobs would be lost in the first year of  Trump âs tariff  and tens of thousands more in the following three years before it expires.
We will be interested to see the tariffâs ultimate effect on the U.S. economy. But for now  a weighing of the evidence on both sides of this debate shows that  Trump  paints a partial picture. Some manufacturing jobs could be created by the tariff  but many more jobs could be wiped out in the fastest-growing sector of the solar industry. For this  we give the president Three Pinocchios.

5064,This Analysis Shows How Viral Fake Election News Stories Outperformed Real News On Facebook,Donald Trump,"A Facebook spokesman told BuzzFeed News that the top stories don't reflect overall engagement on the platform. ""There is a long tail of stories on Facebook "" the spokesman said. ""It may seem like the top stories get a lot of traction  but they represent a tiny fraction of the total."" He also said that native video  live content  and image posts from major news outlets saw significant engagement on Facebook. Of the 20 top-performing false election stories identified in the analysis  all but three were overtly pro-Donald Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton. Two of the biggest false hits were a story claiming Clinton sold weapons to ISIS and a hoax claiming the pope endorsed Trump  which the site removed after publication of this article. The only viral false stories during the final three months that were arguably against  Trump 's interests were a false quote from Mike Pence about Michelle Obama  a false report that Ireland was accepting American ""refugees"" fleeing Trump  and a hoax claiming RuPaul said he was groped by  Trump .
This week BuzzFeed News reported that a group of Facebook employees have formed a task force to tackle the issue  with one saying that ""fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season."" The Wall Street Journal also reported that Google would begin barring fake news websites from its AdSense advertising program. Facebook soon followed suit. These developments follow a study by BuzzFeed News that revealed hyperpartisan Facebook pages and their websites were publishing false or misleading content at an alarming rate â and generating significant Facebook engagement in the process. The same was true for the more than 100 US politics websites BuzzFeed News found being run out of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This new analysis of election content found two false election stories from a Macedonian sites that made the top-10 list in terms of Facebook engagement int he final three months. Conservative State published a story that falsely quoted Hillary Clinton as saying  âI would like to see  people like Donald Trump  run for office;  they âre honest and canât be bought.â The story generated over 481 000 engagements on Facebook. A second false story from a Macedonia site falsely claimed that Clinton was about to be indicted. It received 149 000 engagements on Facebook. All the false news stories identified in BuzzFeed News' analysis came from either fake news websites that only publish hoaxes or from hyperpartisan websites that present themselves as publishing real news. The research turned up only one viral false election story from a hyperpartisan left-wing site. The story from Winning Democrats claimed Ireland was accepting anti-Trump ""refugees"" from the US. It received over 810 000 Facebook engagements  and was debunked by an Irish publication. (There was also one post from an LGBTQ site that used a false quote from  Trump  in its headline.) The other false viral election stories from hyperpartisan sites came from right-wing publishers  according to the analysis.
One example is the remarkably successful  utterly untrustworthy site Ending the Fed. It was responsible for four of the top 10 false election stories identified in the analysis: Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump  Hilary Clinton selling weapons to ISIS  Hillary Clinton being disqualified from holding federal office  and the FBI director receiving millions from the Clinton Foundation. These four stories racked up a total of roughly 2 953 000 Facebook engagements in the three months leading up to Election Day.
That site was only registered in April of this year. Its publisher disputes the idea that its content is aimed at misleading readers. ""The BS Journal is a satire news publication and makes absolutely no secret of that or any attempt to purposely mislead our readers "" he told BuzzFeed News. Large news sites also generated strong Facebook engagement for links to their election stories. But to truly find the biggest election hits from these 19 major sites  it's necessary to go back to early 2016. The three biggest election hits for these outlets came back in February  led by a contributor post on the Huffington Post's blog about Donald Trump that received 2 200 000 engagements on Facebook. The top-performing election news story on Facebook for the 19 outlets analyzed was also published that month by CBS News. It generated an impressive 1.7 million shares  engagements  and comments on Facebook. Overall  a significant number of the top-performing posts on Facebook from major outlets were opinion pieces  rather than news stories. The biggest mainstream hit in the three months prior to the election came from the Washington Post and had 876 000 engagements. Yet somehow Ending the Fed â a site launched just months earlier with no history on Facebook and likely a very small group of people running it â managed to get more engagement for a false story during that same period. âPeople know there are concerned employees who are seeing something here which they consider a big problem â a Facebook manager told BuzzFeed News this week. âAnd it doesnât feel like the people making decisions are taking the concerns seriously.â
BuzzFeed News used the content analysis tool BuzzSumo  which enables users to search for content by keyword  URL  time range  and social share counts. BuzzFeed News searched in BuzzSumo using keywords such as ""Hillary Clinton"" and ""Donald Trump "" as well as combinations such as "" Trump  and election"" or ""Clinton and emails"" to see the top stories about these topics according to Facebook engagement. We also searched for known viral lies such as ""Soros and voting machine."" In addition  created lists of the URLs of known fake news websites  of hyperpartisan sites on the right and on the left  and of the more than 100 pro-Trump sites run from Macedonia that were previously identified in BuzzFeed News reporting. We then looked for the top performing content on Facebook across all of these sites to find false stories about the election. We conducted our searches in three-month segments beginning 9 months from election day. This broke down as February to April  May to July  and August to election day. Even with the above approaches  it's entirely possible that we missed other big hits from fake news websites and hyperpartisan blogs. To examine the performance of election content from mainstream sites  we created a list that included the websites of the New York Times  Washington Post  NBC News  USA Today  Politico  CNN  Wall Street Journal  CBS News  ABC News  New York Daily News  New York Post  BuzzFeed  Los Angeles Times  NPR  The Guardian  Vox  Business Insider  Huffington Post  and Fox News. We then searched for their top-performing election content in the same three-month segments as above. It's important to note that Facebook engagement does not necessarily translate into traffic. This analysis was focused on how the best-performing fake news about the election compared with real news from major outlets on Facebook. It's entirely possible â and likely â that the mainstream sites received more traffic to their top-performing Facebook content than the fake news sites did. As as the Facebook spokesman noted  large news sites overall see more engagement on Facebook than fake news sites.","A Facebook spokesman told BuzzFeed News that the top stories don't reflect overall engagement on the platform. ""There is a long tail of stories on Facebook "" the spokesman said. ""It may seem like the top stories get a lot of traction  but they represent a tiny fraction of the total."" He also said that native video  live content  and image posts from major news outlets saw significant engagement on Facebook. Of the 20 top-performing false election stories identified in the analysis  all but three were overtly pro-Donald Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton. Two of the biggest false hits were a story claiming Clinton sold weapons to ISIS and a hoax claiming the pope endorsed Trump  which the site removed after publication of this article. The only viral false stories during the final three months that were arguably against  Trump 's interests were a false quote from Mike Pence about Michelle Obama  a false report that Ireland was accepting American ""refugees"" fleeing Trump  and a hoax claiming RuPaul said he was groped by  Trump .
This week BuzzFeed News reported that a group of Facebook employees have formed a task force to tackle the issue  with one saying that ""fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season."" The Wall Street Journal also reported that Google would begin barring fake news websites from its AdSense advertising program. Facebook soon followed suit.

5065,Will Trump campaign for GOP candidates in 2018 midterms?,Trump,"1)  Trump 's 2018 midterms mindset
It's now 2018 and for both political parties  that means the focus is all on midterm elections. This past weekend  as  President Trump  met with advisers and Republican leaders   he  was briefed on the GOP midterms strategy.
As CNN's Jeff Zeleny reports  one question is how much we will see  Trump  on the campaign trail.
""President Trump  I'm told  is increasingly focusing on House and Senate races.  He 's saying  he 'll do whatever  he  can to help  even if that means staying away  "" Zeleny says. "" He 'll raise money for them but will  he  be asked to campaign for them?
"" He  has not shown a willingness to really help anyone besides  himself  at these rallies. We'll see what  his  role is in 2018.""
The DACA policy on immigration  and what to do about so-called Dreamers  have been in the headlines as both parties try to negotiate a permanent government spending bill. But the Trump White House has actually been talking about immigration reform in the broader sense.
Steve Bannon has gone from White House chief strategist to outside ally to earning a derisive nickname name  ""Sloppy Steve "" from the President. Now that Bannon appears to be out of favor with Trump  his political future also seems uncertain.","1)  Trump 's 2018 midterms mindset

5066,Befuddled By Trump  Senate Will Not Vote On Gun Measures Next Week : NPR,Trump,"Befuddled By  Trump   Senate Will Not Vote On Gun Measures Next Week
Plans for a speedy Senate vote on gun legislation crumbled Thursday as Senate leaders announced plans to move on to long-planned banking legislation  while congressional Republicans struggle to make sense of  President Trump 's wishes on guns.
The sharp departure was the result of widespread confusion on Capitol Hill over guns. Republicans spent the day Thursday struggling to respond to a set of vague instructions  Trump  laid out during a televised meeting at the White House.
That meeting followed a familiar pattern for many lawmakers who are trying to write and pass legislation that can meet  Trump 's shifting approval. Even many Republicans responded to the White House meeting with confusion and frustration over the lack of clear guidance from the president.
Over the course of the hourlong broadcast  Trump  seemed to embrace plans to expand background checks and increase age limits for purchasing long gun rifles  positions generally anathema to congressional Republicans.  He  also suggested pre-emptively taking guns away from potentially dangerous people  a policy that might draw significant legal challenges.
The disconnect between  Trump  and congressional Republicans on core philosophical issues on display this week  coupled with the lingering partisan anger between the two parties following the failed immigration talks  is quickly lowering already dim expectations that 2018 will result in much legislative output.
""I'm not inclined to do anything right now except to see what comes up "" Shelby said. ""We all are interested in our children being safe in schools; we're all interested in the communities being safe. It's how do we get there? ""
Trump  often acknowledges that it's hard to pass any legislation in Congress  let alone laws to curb gun rights. But many lawmakers  including some Republicans  say  Trump 's own statements make the already difficult task of passing gun legislation even harder.
The meeting concluded with  Trump  asking lawmakers to go back and talk about the extensive list of proposals floated at the meeting  and without a White House endorsement of any specific plan.
Republicans still reeling from the fallout of Trump's conflicting comments during Wednesday's gun meeting were again taken by surprise Thursday with the White House announcement of impending tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. The decision upends long-standing GOP orthodoxy on trade policy and provoked fears among senators of a trade war with China and other traditional allies that threatens to harm the U.S. economy more than tariffs promise to help.
Sen. Ron Johnson  R-Wis.  said the president's decision is counter to the view of the Senate GOP Conference  which has in prior meetings urged  Trump  not to impose these tariffs. ""I think every Republican is pretty well on the same side of the page from that standpoint  resisting what [ Trump ] and  his  trade advisers were talking about "" Johnson said. ""We have been talking to the administration almost in a unanimous fashion  warning against protectionist measures  warning against these types of tariffs.""","Befuddled By  [TGT]  Will Not Vote On Gun Measures Next Week

5070,So why hasn't anyone ever seen Trump 's supposed dementia?,Trump,"Wolff points out that  Trump  is a man who is continuously seen in public  far more so than any of his political rivals:
Writing in the Washington Examiner  Eddie Scarry makes a good point asking how  if  President Trump  really is in the throes of dementia â can't read  doesn't learn  etc.  as so many of Michael Wolff's supposed White House whisperers claim â why hasn't the public actually seen any of this ?
Where was this version of  Trump  when giving one of  his  dozens of interviews  hosting  his  rallies  or delivering public remarks at any point between 2015 and now? Yes   Trump  mostly spoke extemporaneously during the campaign  often repeating words and themes  a phenomenon otherwise known as speaking aloud. But  he 's also delivered dozens of speeches off teleprompters  proving  he  can actually read  frequently going off-script to offer commentary and then returning to the prepared remarks. During the campaign  from January to September in 2016   he  hosted more than four[] and[] a[] half hours['] worth of press conferences  compared to Hillary Clinton's 38 minutes['] worth.
Scarry suggests placing a genuinely impaired elderly person on a stage and comparing  him  to  Trump  to see the contrast.
Then there are politicians who try to hide that there are any health problems  such as Hillary Clinton  who has had massive coughing attacks in public  was seen with an odd red spot on her tongue  required a stool to lean on during her presidential campaign debate with Trump  has had apparent seizures during press gaggles that she attempted to laugh off  struggled to climb stairs  and has collapsed repeatedly in public. She's never been straight with the public about what her health concerns may be  but it's pretty obvious something is not working.
Do we ever see any evidence of failing faculties like that with  Donald Trump ?  His  own physician gave  him  a clean bill of health  and all we have seen is an ""on"" political leader  always crisply dressed and in full command of his faculties. That he sometimes says things that aren't tactful is part of his extraverted personality. He's not a sneaky  passive-aggressive type. What it isn't is evidence of mental instability.
If  psychiatrists want to ruin their professional reputations by saying Trump is mad  and Michael Wolff wants to make up stuff to sell books  fine .

5073,Iran says may withdraw from nuclear deal if banks continue to stay away,Donald Trump,"Adding to those concerns   U.S. President Donald Trump  told the Europeans on Jan. 12 they must agree to âfix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear dealâ or  he  would re-impose the sanctions Washington lifted as part of that pact.

5074,Trump administration plan would roll back environmental reviews covering use of public lands,Trump,"A logging truck travels on the Katahdin Woods and Waters scenic byway in Patten  Maine  in August 2017. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended in  his final report to President Trump  on Dec. 5  that timbering should be allowed in the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument  just west of the byway  and that infrastructure upgrades and public access for ""traditional uses"" such as snowmobiling and hunting should be prioritized in a management plan. (Robert F. Bukaty/Associated Press)
 The Sept. 27 report  â which was issued in response to a March 27 memo from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke  but never publicly released â amounts to a blueprint for how the  Trump  administration plans to expedite extractive activities on 245 million acres of public land and 700 million acres of the mineral estate below the surface.

5075,Trump is right,Trump,"President Trump 's opponents naturally have criticized  him  over a lengthy phone call  he  had Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But the call may represent the beginning of new U.S.-Russia dialogue that could lead to an important breakthrough in relations.
According to the White House  the two leaders spoke for over an hour and discussed Syria  fighting terrorism in the Middle East and Central Asia  Ukraine  the Iran nuclear deal  and North Korea.  President Trump  said that  he  and Putin spoke ""very strongly about bringing peace to Syria"" and ""very strongly about North Korea.""
Here are a few thoughts about  the Trump-Putin phone call .
First   President Trump  is right that the United States needs to find a way to live with and cooperate with Russia. This doesn't mean the U.S. has to accept Russia's belligerent and destabilizing actions. But Americans need to understand that our ability to change Russian behavior is very limited.
Dialogue like  the Trump-Putin phone call  could improve relations and help both sides find areas of potential cooperation. Such dialogue also is certain to be more productive than the Obama administration's aimless policy of sanctioning Russia and issuing ultimatums that it failed to enforce.
Second  while  the Trump-Putin phone call  may be a positive development  it was part of a broader effort by Putin to take the initiative in the Middle East  especially in devising a post-ISIS strategy for Syria that favors Russia's ally  Syrian President Bashar Assad.
Obviously  a Russian-led peace process that includes Iran and excludes the United States is not in U.S. interests or in the interests of America's friends and allies in the Middle East.  President Trump  is working to counter Putin's effort by reasserting American leadership in the Middle East and likely will use  his  interactions with the Russian president to make this clear.
Third   President Trump 's foreign policy priority appears to be ending North Koreaâs nuclear weapons program.  He  may be willing to make a deal with Moscow to win its support for achieving that goal.
 President Trump  probably is looking for a way to ensure that Russia does not throw North Korea a lifeline at the same that China is beginning to enforce tough United Nations sanctions. This could mean the U.S. is considering some kind of deal with Russia to address the situation in Ukraine  possibly by deploying U.N. peacekeepers.
The mainstream media and the left will engage in histrionics over the call and use it to continue their conspiracy narrative of  President Trump  collaborating with and being too cozy with Russia. But the communications between the two presidents marks the return of a decisive and principled American president who understands that the United States and Russia must find a way to live together and cooperate."," [TGT]  's opponents naturally have criticized   [TGT]   over a lengthy phone call   [TGT]   had Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

5076,More than 200 to be laid off at Indiana factory year after Trump deal,Donald Trump,"A new round of layoffs is taking effect this week at the Carrier Corp. factory in Indianapolis a little more than a year after President Donald Trump touted a deal that staved off the plant's closure and saved some of its jobs.
 Trump  frequently criticized Carrier's plant closing plans during the 2016 campaign.  He  traveled to the Indianapolis factory three weeks after  his  election win to announce a tax-incentive agreement partially reversing the closure and keeping some 800 furnace production jobs.
Retired United Steelworkers Local 1999 President Chuck Jones  who was chastised by a  Trump  tweet after complaining that  Trump  gave false hope to Carrier workers by inflating the number of jobs being saved  said the president hasn't followed up on his campaign talk of stopping the country's loss of manufacturing jobs.
 Trump  and other Republicans maintain the business tax cuts included in the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul he signed into law last month will lead to more jobs and higher wages across the country.
The latest Carrier job cuts follow the final closing in November of a 350-worker Rexnord Corp. industrial bearings factory in Indianapolis. Milwaukee-based Rexnord didn't change its decision to shift much of the factory's work to Mexico despite a tweet from  Trump  blasting Rexnord for ""rather viciously firing"" its workers.","A new round of layoffs is taking effect this week at the Carrier Corp. factory in Indianapolis a little more than a year after  [TGT]  touted a deal that staved off the plant's closure and saved some of its jobs.

5077,Trump  Dems in row over who is running the CFPB,Trump,"But  the Trump administration  says that the president has the right to name the acting director.  Accordingly  Trump  appointed  his  budget chief  Mick Mulvaney to the post.
On Saturday   Trump  tweeted that the CFPB - which has imposed steep penalties on banks  auto dealers  student lenders and credit card companies for predatory lending practices - had âdevastatedâ financial institutions. Democrats and Republicans agree that  Trump  may nominate a permanent CFPB chief  but they disagree over who may lead the agency in the interim   a dispute which could drag on for months until the Senate confirms a permanent Trump appointment .  The dispute  is over which federal law prevails in naming an interim director. According to Democrats  the relevant law is the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the CFPB  which stipulates that the agencyâs deputy director is to take over in the short term. Cordray  in announcing his resignation on Friday  said he had named English as deputy director and that she would become the acting director. But administration officials say the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives the president the power to temporarily fill agency positions  except for those with multi-member boards - an exemption they said did not apply to the CFPB.
Part of the confusion stems from the status of the CFPB as an independent government agency. There are several court challenges underway to that designation  which should give  Trump  the power to name an interim replacement.
On Saturday evening  the Justice Department said in a memo that the White House was right to name a new CFPB director. The Dodd-Frank language about changing CFPB directors is âunusualâ but the White House may name an interim chief  according to the memo. Such advice from the Justice Department is open to legal challenge. Alan Kaplinsky  head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP  said the issue will likely have to be decided in the courts. In the meantime  he said  âThis enormous cloud of uncertaintyâ will hang over the CFPB. Kaplinsky said he believes that Dodd-Frank provides for the deputy director to take charge during the short-term  but Congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up. âI think  Trump  wins  but unfortunately it is going to take a while â Kaplinsky said.","But  the Trump administration  says that the president has the right to name the acting director.

5078,Donât Just Look At Trumpâs Approval Rating To Judge His First 100 Days,Trump,"With  President Trumpâs  100th day in office approaching  analysts and pundits are taking stock of  his  performance. How âs   he  doing? The simplest  most common way to answer that question is to look at  Trumpâs  approval rating (itâs low  but the bottom hasnât fallen out). And thatâs a perfectly fine measure by which to judge the White House; approval ratings tell us how Americans feel about  Trump   and â eventually â theyâll do a good job at approximating his chances of re-election.
But presidential approval is not a great measure of the more immediate electoral issue: How will the presidentâs party do in the midterm elections? By all means  keep one eye on  Trumpâs  approval rating  but keep the other on the generic congressional ballot â a longstanding poll question that pits a nameless Republican against a nameless Democrat in a race for the House.
Approval ratings have historically jumped all over the place  and even on the eve of the midterms  they do a relatively poor job of forecasting the election results. The generic ballot  in contrast  has tended to be far more telling. And the generic ballot polls conducted since  Trump  became president suggest that House Republicans are on track to suffer a potentially major defeat in the 2018 midterm elections.
Even when Democrats were busy crafting and eventually introducing a fairly unpopular health care bill in the middle of 2009  they still held a 3 percentage point lead on the generic ballot for the 2010 midterm elections. This year  a combination of Trumpâs unpopularity and House Republicansâ inability to pass any major legislation has likely contributed to Americans wanting to put Democrats back in charge.
Of course  itâs far from guaranteed that Democrats would win the House vote by exactly 8 percentage points. Like with a presidentâs approval rating  generic ballot margins tend to undergo a reversion toward the mean  just as the presidentâs partyâs standing tends to decline. The fact that  Trump  is already so unpopular may mean that  he  wonât become more unpopular as the midterm approaches. Therefore  the Democratsâ lead in the generic ballot may not expand further  instead holding steady the way it did in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal. Itâs also possible that some event (e.g. a terrorist attack) interrupts the normal historical trend  and the White House Party gains ground on the generic ballot  as Republicans did after 9/11.
Still  while youâre reading dozens of 100-day analyses this week  leave some room for the generic ballot. Democratsâ 5 percentage point lead is probably one of the worst signs for  Trump  and the GOP. It shows that Trumpâs unpopularity is translating down-ballot and hurting  his party . When you combine the generic ballot numbers with high Democratic enthusiasm  thereâs no sign that  Trumpâs Republican Party  has some unique ability to âdefy midterm gravity.â The GOPâs House majority is in danger.","With  [TGT] 100th day in office approaching  analysts and pundits are taking stock of   [TGT]   performance.

According to an NBC News analysis  Trump and  his  relatives could save upwards of $1 billion if the tax plan that the House passed a couple of weeks ago becomes law. The prospective windfall would principally be thanks to the bill's plan to repeal the estate tax.
The plan slated for a Senate vote later this week also disproportionately favors wealthy Americans like  Trump   with a clear majority of its benefits going to those occupying the highest tax brackets  according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

 US President Donald Trump  has said Israeli settlements ""complicate"" the peace process with Palestinians and urged ""care"" over the issue.
 He  also told an Israeli newspaper that  he  did not believe the Palestinians  and possibly Israel as well  were ready to make peace.
 President Trump  angered Palestinians in December when  he  recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

5089,Trump says open to temporary healthcare reform deal with Democrats,Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  U.S. President Donald Trump  said on Saturday  he  would be open to cutting a one-year or two-year deal with Democratic rivals as a way to kick-start reform of the nationâs healthcare system  a key campaign pledge made by  Trump  and the Republican Party.
 Trump  has been frustrated by the failure  openly taunting Republicans as âtotal quittersâ and âfoolsâ this summer over their inability in the Senate to replace Obamacare.
âIf we made a temporary deal  I think it would be a great thing for people  but itâs really up to them (Democrats) â  Trump  told reporters at the White House.
âSo if we could do a one-year deal or two-year deal as a temporary measure  youâll have block granting ultimately to the states  which is what Republicans want â  Trump  said.
Earlier on Saturday  Trump  said  he  had called Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to gauge interest in working on what  he  called a âgreatâ healthcare bill to replace Obamacare.
âI called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill â  Trump  wrote on Twitter earlier on Saturday. âObamaCare is badly broken  big premiums. Who knows!â
Axios first reported Trumpâs call to Schumer on Friday.

Schumer said  Trump  had told him during the phone call on Friday that he wanted to try again to repeal and replace Obamacare.
âI told  the president  thatâs off the table â Schumer said in a statement. âIf he wants to work together to improve the existing health care system  we Democrats are open to his suggestions.â
Alexander pulled out of  the talks  last month as a new Republican bill to repeal Obamacare gained momentum. After that bill collapsed  Alexander said he would again consult with Murray.
Although Democrats have been mostly united against Trumpâs agenda  there is a precedent for a bipartisan deal. Last month   Trump  sided with Democrats in a surprising debt limit deal that blindsided Republicans and left conservative groups aghast.
But there are still wide policy differences between Democrats and  Trump .  His  administration on Friday undermined requirements under Obamacare that employers provide insurance to cover womenâs birth control.
A Democratic aide said  the Trump administration  would have to abandon such efforts before  it  could reach a healthcare deal with Republicans.

5090,Breaking with tradition  Trump skips presidentâs written intelligence report and relies on oral briefings,Trump,"Breaking with tradition   Trump  skips presidentâs written intelligence report and relies on oral briefings
 President Trump  has stopped reading the traditional presidential daily briefing document  and instead opts for an oral overview of intelligence matters every two to three days. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
For much of the past year   President Trump  has declined to participate in a practice followed by the past seven of  his  predecessors:  He  rarely if ever reads the Presidentâs Daily Brief  a document that lays out the most pressing information collected by U.S. intelligence agencies from hot spots around the world.
 Trump  has opted to rely on an oral briefing of select intelligence issues in the Oval Office rather than getting the full written document delivered to review separately each day  according to three people familiar with  his  briefings.
Reading the traditionally dense intelligence book is not  Trumpâs  preferred âstyle of learning â according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
The arrangement underscores  Trumpâs  impatience with exhaustive classified documents that go to the commander in chief â material that  he  has said  he  prefers condensed as much as possible. But by not reading the daily briefing   the president  could hamper  his  ability to respond to crises in the most effective manner  intelligence experts warned.
 Soon after Trump took office   analysts sought to tailor their intelligence sessions for a president with a famously short attention span  who is known for taking in much of  his  information from conservative Fox News Channel hosts. The oral briefings were augmented with photos  videos and graphics.
After several months   Trump  made clear  he  was not interested in reviewing a personal copy of the written intelligence report known as the PDB  a highly classified summary prepared before dawn to provide  the president  with the best update on the worldâs events  according to people with knowledge of the situation.
Administration officials defended Trumpâs reliance on oral sessions and said  he  gets full intelligence briefings  noting that presidents have historically sought to receive the information in different ways.
Michael Anton  a spokesman for the National Security Council  said  Trump  âis an avid consumer of intelligence  appreciates the hard work of  his  briefers and of the entire intelligence community and looks forward every day to the give and take of  his  intelligence briefings.â
Daniel Coats  the director of national intelligence  said in a statement that âany notion that  President Trump  is not fully engaged in the PDB or does not read the briefing materials is pure fiction and is clearly not based on firsthand knowledge of the process.â
He added that  Trumpâs  routine sessions with senior intelligence advisers âdemonstrate his interest in and appreciation for the value of the intelligence provided. In fact   President Trump  engages for significantly longer periods than I understand many previous presidents have done.â
Related: [ Trumpâs  favorite general: Can Mattis check an impulsive president and still retain his trust? ]
Several intelligence experts said that the presidentâs aversion to diving deeper into written intelligence details â the âhomeworkâ that past presidents have done to familiarize themselves with foreign policy and national security â makes both  him  and the country more vulnerable.
Leon Panetta  a former CIA director and defense secretary for President Barack Obama  said  Trump  could miss important context and nuance if he is relying solely on an oral briefing. The arrangement also increases pressure on the presidentâs national security team  which cannot entirely replace a well-informed commander in chief  he said.
Mark Lowenthal  a career intelligence officer who served as a CIA assistant director from 2002 to 2005  said  Trump  does not have to read the PDB if  he  is getting an extensive oral briefing.  He  warned  however  that a short briefing on a few select items would leave the president ill-equipped for major decisions over the long term.","Breaking with tradition   Trump  skips presidentâs written intelligence report and relies on oral briefings

5091,Trump Says Will be 'flexible' on NAFTA Ahead of Mexico's Election,Donald Trump,"U.S. President Donald Trump  said on Thursday  he  would be ""a little bit flexible"" on  his  threat to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement because Mexico is facing a presidential election later this year.
""I understand that a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election  "" Trump  said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.
 Trump  also said Mexico can pay for a border wall between the two countries ""indirectly"" through changes to the trade deal.
U.S.  Canadian and Mexican officials meet this month for the sixth and penultimate round of  talks to update NAFTA  which President Donald Trump has threatened to abandon unless major changes are made .
 The talks  start on Jan. 23  just weeks after Canada launched a wide-ranging complaint against the United States at the World Trade Organization  potentially complicating NAFTA negotiations. The complaint challenges Washingtonâs use of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.
Canada has so far largely shunned confrontation with Washington  stressing instead the merits of NAFTA and free trade as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau makes efforts to forge closer ties with  Trump .
But  Trump âs more isolationist approach has put strains on the bilateral trading relationship between the two countries  the second largest of  its  kind in the world.
âThereâs nothing that Canada could do  short of setting fire to the White House again  that would change the trajectory of whatever it is that Donald Trump is going to do â she said in reference to an 1812 war.","[TGT] said on Thursday   [TGT]   would be ""a little bit flexible"" on   [TGT]   threat to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement because Mexico is facing a presidential election later this year.

U.S.  Canadian and Mexican officials meet this month for the sixth and penultimate round of  talks to update NAFTA  which  [TGT]  has threatened to abandon unless major changes are made .
 The talks  start on Jan. 23  just weeks after Canada launched a wide-ranging complaint against the United States at the World Trade Organization  potentially complicating NAFTA negotiations. The complaint challenges Washingtonâs use of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties.
Canada has so far largely shunned confrontation with Washington  stressing instead the merits of NAFTA and free trade as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau makes efforts to forge closer ties with  Trump .
But  Trump âs more isolationist approach has put strains on the bilateral trading relationship between the two countries  the second largest of  its  kind in the world.

5092,Democrats get desperate as accusations of Trump,Trump,"President Trump  speaks on Friday at the White House in Washington. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)
With all the noise coming from  the president  last week (and the week before that  and so far this weekâ¦)  a bit of good news for this embattled White House may be emerging. And if the American body politic doesnât experience a complete meltdown this week  perhaps others will notice.
The good news is that after having tried everything else   the Trump team  now appears to be cooperating in a normal way with special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIâs investigation. According to a recent New York Times report  â The presidentâs legal team  is working swiftly to respond to requests from Mr. Mueller for emails  documents and memos  and will make White House officials available for interviews.â Itâs about time. After months of leaks  innuendo  willful ignorance and wild speculation  nothing has pointed to anything approaching substantive collusion with Russia on the part of the president or  the Trump campaign . But the investigation is ongoing  and the White House has decided to stop acting as though it is guilty â or at least hiding something â and begin acting as if it is innocent. Imagine.
Since the investigation began  Paul Manafort  Michael Flynn and others have tacitly admitted to Foreign Agents Registration Act violations  answered questions about this or that meeting or been subject to aggressive moves by Muellerâs investigative team looking into the financial dealings of some of President Trumpâs associates. And yet  nothing has confirmed â or even suggested â nefarious collusion between Russia and  the Trump campaign . These collateral reports are all sideshows used by the media to create the impression that something significant could still arise connecting  the Trump campaign  to Russia. But they are just a lot of fog.
But in Washington  being innocent is only an advantage â it is not determinative. Democrats in Congress and liberals everywhere will refuse to accept Muellerâs inevitable finding of no collusion. And even as the collusion story fades  the mainstream mediaâs latest fixation is that  somehow  Russian manipulation of social media ads during the 2016 campaign was significant. But if the media really thinks this issue is a big deal  it should be asking where the Obama administration was when all this egregious hijacking of American democracy took place. Will anyone suggest that the Obama administration was to blame and that the former presidentâs incompetence led to this problem  or will they somehow make the story about Trump?
Fractured and without a legitimate agenda  Democrats have nothing going for them besides Trumpâs tweets and making false accusations about the president and those around him. Theyâve propped up the Trump-Russia collusion story for too long  and now that the White House is cooperating with Muellerâs investigation  liberals are beginning to look desperate.

 President Trump  has begun telling advisers that it will likely be impossible to advance legislation this year to reduce welfare spending and enrollment â a priority  he  previously embraced with the backing of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and a number of conservative activists.
In conversations with aides and outside advisers in recent days   Trump  has said  his  supporters would embrace the idea â but that it remains unlikely because the votes will not be there in Congress and it would be a difficult undertaking in an election year. Some Republicans want to reduce health-care  housing and food-stamp spending by making it tougher for beneficiaries to receive the dollars â such as through new work requirements.
But a number of White House officials and advisers have begun tamping down expectations for any overhaul of social safety-net programs  and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has told  Trump  itâs a nonstarter in  his  chamber because  he  would need the support of Democrats who oppose the idea  a White House adviser said.

Discussions about this yearâs legislative agenda began Friday at Camp David  where  Trump  is hosting a retreat with McConnell  Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republican leaders  who want to hash out details of an immigration plan and a cohesive strategy for this year  when Republicans are likely to face a difficult political terrain ahead of the midterm elections.
 Trump  advisers are also looking for wedge issues that would force Democrats in largely Republican states to take âtough votesâ to make  their  reelection odds tougher  according to a White House official  and to build support for an infrastructure plan that could be difficult to pass.
 Trump  and legislators face deadlines on immigration and spending â government funding expires later this month  and tensions over what to do with âdreamers â immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program who arrived in the country illegally as children  need to be resolved by March 5. The two issues have become intertwined  but Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate have made little progress on the negotiations.
At a private meeting at the White House on Thursday  Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told  Trump  and fellow senators that Ryan wanted the Senate to go first on trying to pass immigration legislation and that the House would try to follow. Ryan has told White House advisers that the issue is âtoxicâ and he wants it done  according to two people familiar with the conversation. A senior House aide said Ryan would have certain priorities in any bill  as well  and was not entirely deferring to the Senate.
 Trump  has also told a number of aides and outside advisers in recent days that  he  is concerned Republicans will not support an infrastructure plan  even though  he  wants one and sees it as a good midterm election play. White House aides are trying to determine what a plan looks like and how to pay for it â possibly through state contributions or private-sector investments.
 Trump  seems more interested in infrastructure than other subjects  aides said  talking about building and  his  former life in construction.  He  often notes how much  he  thinks different things could cost â and how it would be good for  him  politically to travel throughout the country to promote new projects.
Another showdown could come over earmarks. The House Rules Committee will convene hearings this month on earmarks  House aides said. The hearings are not a sign of renewed interest from leadership in installing earmarks â spending designated for specific home-state projects â as a way to reclaim control over unruly lawmakers. Instead  they will fulfill a commitment by Ryan to some members of the Appropriations Committee who pushed for the limited reinstatement of earmarks when rules were set for the 115th Congress shortly after  Trumpâs election .
At the time  some rules changes pushed by the appropriators came close to passing  and Ryan had to intervene to shoot them down  pointing to how bad the optics would be to reinstate earmarks behind closed doors just when Trump was elected to âdrain the swamp.â The issue was put off but is now coming back up. Reinstating earmarks could be bad politics in an election year.
âThat would be a disaster for them if they put that issue on the agenda â said David McIntosh  president of Club for Growth. âThey were smart enough to avoid it in their rules session right after  the election .

5098,NeverTrumps Renamed: AlwaysDemocrats,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  is approaching the end of  his  first year in the White House with an impressive list of accomplishments: a big tax cut  repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate  huge regulatory rollback  judicial appointments including Neil Gorsuch  the Keystone pipeline  Paris Accords withdrawal  ANWR drilling  recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital  and a first bite at immigration reform.
It seems inexplicable. Former Cabinet secretary in the Reagan administration Bill Bennett believes that  Donald Trump  is more conservative than Ronald Reagan and that  his  Cabinet selections are  too. That's quite the endorsement from someone who was part of the Reagan revolution â not some conservative pundit saying this  but a true Reaganite.
Stephens wrote a recent column  ""Why I'm still a NeverTrumper [sic]."" After rattling off a list of  Trump 's first-year accomplishments  he asks  ""What  for a conservative  is there to dislike about this policy record as the  Trump  administration rounds out its first year in office?""
Good question. The easy answer for most conservatives is ""nothing."" Sure  the wall isn't built yet  and Obamacare is still in place.  Trump 's fault or Congress's? But overall  it's been a great first year  as Mr. Stephens observes â despite the fact that  Trump  is opposed by all three branches of government  even the one he presides over.
 Trump  is fighting Deep State imbeds in the Executive Branch. Just observe the DOJ and FBI and how they concocted the Russia collusion story to prevent  then destroy  his presidency. In the Legislative Branch   Trump  is opposed not only by Democrats  but also by many Republicans. The judiciary is no better  substituting personal animosity for the rule of law  especially regarding immigration policy.
Suppose Stephens got his wish â a Madame President. None of  Trump 's accomplishments would have come to pass. A far-left agenda would have pushed America to a point of no return as the America Stephens and his fellow NeverTrumps profess to desire.  Trump  is actually accomplishing what these so-called conservatives only talk about but never achieve."," [TGT] is approaching the end of   [TGT]   first year in the White House with an impressive list of accomplishments: a big tax cut  repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate  huge regulatory rollback  judicial appointments including Neil Gorsuch  the Keystone pipeline  Paris Accords withdrawal  ANWR drilling  recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital  and a first bite at immigration reform.
It seems inexplicable. Former Cabinet secretary in the Reagan administration Bill Bennett believes that   [TGT] is more conservative than Ronald Reagan and that  his  Cabinet selections are  too. That's quite the endorsement from someone who was part of the Reagan revolution â not some conservative pundit saying this  but a true Reaganite.
Stephens wrote a recent column  ""Why I'm still a NeverTrumper [sic]."" After rattling off a list of  Trump 's first-year accomplishments  he asks  ""What  for a conservative  is there to dislike about this policy record as the   [TGT]   administration rounds out its first year in office?""
Good question. The easy answer for most conservatives is ""nothing."" Sure  the wall isn't built yet  and Obamacare is still in place.   [TGT]  's fault or Congress's? But overall  it's been a great first year  as Mr. Stephens observes â despite the fact that   [TGT]   is opposed by all three branches of government  even the one he presides over.
 Trump  is fighting Deep State imbeds in the Executive Branch. Just observe the DOJ and FBI and how they concocted the Russia collusion story to prevent  then destroy  his presidency. In the Legislative Branch   Trump  is opposed not only by Democrats  but also by many Republicans. The judiciary is no better  substituting personal animosity for the rule of law  especially regarding immigration policy.

5100,Donald Trump Tries to Revive Talks for 'Great' Health Law,Donald Trump,"(WASHINGTON) â Trying to revive health care talks   President Donald Trump  tweeted Saturday that  he  had spoken to the Senate's Democratic leader to gauge whether the minority party was interested in helping pass ""great"" health legislation.
The answer back: Democrats are willing to hear  his  ideas  but scrapping the Obama health law is a nonstarter.
 Trump 's latest overture to Democrats follows GOP failures so far to fulfill their yearslong promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act despite controlling the White House and Congress since January.
 The president  tweeted that  he  called New York Sen. Chuck Schumer on Friday to discuss the 2010 law  which  Trump  said ""is badly broken  big premiums. Who knows!""  Trump  said  he  wanted ""to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill.""
Schumer said through a spokesman Saturday that  Trump  ""wanted to make another run at repeal and replace and I told the president that's off the table."" Schumer said if  Trump  ""wants to work together to improve the existing health care system  we Democrats are open to his suggestions.""
 Trump  has suggested before that  he  would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health care  but there have been no clear signs of a compromise between Republicans who have sought to scrap former President Barack Obama's law and Democrats who want to protect it.
 Trump  irritated GOP leaders in Congress when  he  reached a deal with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  D-Calif.  on a spending bill and the debt ceiling.  The president  has referred to those two Democrats as ""Chuck and Nancy.""
But  the Trump administration  announced Friday that  it  would allow more employers to opt out of no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections. The move was one more attempt to roll back Obama's health overhaul  prompting Democrats to question whether  Trump  is committed to avoiding sabotaging the law.
 Trump  floated the potential talks as  he  approved an emergency declaration for a large part of Louisiana and ordered federal assistance for the state as Hurricane Nate approached the central Gulf of Mexico.
 The president  was also headlining a fundraiser on Saturday night in Greensboro  North Carolina  to benefit  his   Trump  Victory joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee. The event was expected to raise $2 million  with donors paying up to $35 000 per couple to serve as co-hosts.","(WASHINGTON) â Trying to revive health care talks    [TGT] tweeted Saturday that   [TGT]   had spoken to the Senate's Democratic leader to gauge whether the minority party was interested in helping pass ""great"" health legislation.

5101,Why it's hard for Trump to 'rip up' the Iran deal,Trump,"President Donald Trump  may have a hard time ""ripping up"" the ""disastrous"" Iran nuclear deal  as  he  promised to do while campaigning.
 Trump  is expected to announce  his  decision to ""decertify"" the deal on Friday  according to various media reports. This move would essentially leave the deal in place  but make it a congressional decision whether to reimpose nuclear sanctions.
It would also theoretically allow  Trump  to distance  himself  from a deal brokered under President Barack Obama.
 Trump  faces opposition to this decision on a number of fronts â within  his  own administration  inside a Republican controlled Congress  and from other world powers.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis  and top national security aides have reportedly pressured  Trump  to recertify the Iran deal. Passed in 2015  the agreement must be recertified by the president every 90 days  as required by Congress.
Mattis has publicly broken with the president  telling Congress earlier this month he believes it is in the US national security interest to remain a party to the agreement. His testimony reveals why it might be tricky for  Trump  to leave the deal â there is no evidence that Iran has violated it. And breaking from an agreement that Iran hasn't violated could hurt US credibility on the world stage at a time when world powers are trying to prevent North Korea from launching a nuclear strike.
It seems that by punting the decision to Congress   Trump  may be saving the deal â even though every Republican in Congress opposed it at the time.

5103,Mueller interviewed Steele: Dossier on Trump comes into focus,Trump,"Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigative team interviewed the veteran British spy who compiled the explosive  Trump-Russia  dossier over the summer.
The timeline of major  game-changing events that unfolded in the final months of the election coincided with several of  the dossier 's allegations of conspiracy and misconduct between several  Trump  associates and  Russia .
Special counsel Robert Mueller has interviewed the veteran British spy who wrote a collection of explosive memos alleging ties between  President Donald Trump 's campaign team and  Russia   CNN reported on Thursday.
The revelation came one day after the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee  Richard Burr  told reporters that the committee had been working ""backwards"" to examine the memos as part of its separate but parallel investigation into  Russia 's election meddling.
The memos were compiled into a dossier by veteran British spy Christopher Steele  who was hired by a Washington  DC-based opposition research firm in June 2016 to investigate the  Trump  campaign's ties to  Russia . The firm  Fusion GPS  was first hired by unspecified anti-Trump Republicans in late 2015. Democrats took over funding for the firm's work after  Trump  won the GOP nomination.
Steele produced memos from June through December  at which point Fusion  with his permission  gave the dossier to Republican Sen. John McCain. McCain then gave it to the FBI director at the time  James Comey. Comey  along with the former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan  briefed both President Barack Obama and then-President elect Trump on the dossier's allegations in January.
The document includes allegations of a quid-pro-quo in which Russia agreed to leak the hacked Democratic National Committee emails to WikiLeaks in exchange for  the Trump campaign sidelining Russian aggression in Ukraine as a campaign issue . It also alleges that  Trump 's former campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  managed the communication between Russia and the campaign.
We now know that  while he was campaign chairman  Manafort offered to give ""private briefings"" about  the Trump campaign  to a Russian oligarch and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin  according to emails reviewed last month by The Washington Post and The Atlantic. Manafort also asked a longtime Russian-Ukrainian employee in early April how he could use his media coverage and high-level campaign role to collect past debts.
At least five other  Trump  associates â Attorney General Jeff Sessions  former national security adviser Michael Flynn  longtime confidant Roger Stone  former campaign adviser Carter Page  and campaign national security adviser JD Gordon â reportedly met with Russia's ambassador to the US  Sergey Kislyak  in the latter half of 2016. The FBI reportedly obtained a FISA warrant to monitor Page's communications after he returned from a trip to Moscow last July. He and Flynn are named in the dossier as being complicit in the alleged collusion.

5104,Calling For 'Renewal Of The American Spirit ' Trump Outlines His Vision : NPR,Trump,"Calling For 'Renewal Of  The American Spirit ' Trump Outlines His Vision
President Trump  pushed the reset button after a rocky first month in office  delivering an on-message joint address to Congress that outlined his vision for America.
""I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength  and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart  "" Trump  said at the outset  declaring that ""the torch of truth  liberty and justice ... is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world.""
""The time for trivial fights is behind us  "" Trump  declared at the end of  his  speech â a somewhat ironic statement given  his  proclivity for picking Twitter fights and zeroing in on petty things like disputes over the size of  his  inauguration crowd.
But throughout the more than hourlong address  Trump heeded that call  as  he  himself implored the country to ""embrace this renewal of the American spirit.""
 Trump  began the speech by touting the accomplishments  he  has already checked off in office â including withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership  ordering construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines  he  argued would create jobs  and nominating conservative Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.
But on what  he  would still do in office   Trump  was often short on specifics and instead spoke in  his  usual broad generalities.
 Trump  redoubled on Republicans' longtime campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare  even as the GOP has had difficulty coalescing around one replacement.
 Trump  said  he  still wants to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions are covered and also said  he  supports letting people purchase plans ""through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts"" and ""to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines.""
There were also some head fakes from the administration. While  Trump  told news anchors in a lunch meeting earlier Tuesday  he  was open to bipartisan immigration overhaul  that never made it into  his  speech.
 Instead  Trump  continued to hew to hard-line rhetoric on immigration  recognizing families  he  invited to the speech who had lost loved ones to crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants.  He  announced  he  had ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create a new office called ""VOICE"" â Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement â that would provide ""a voice to those who have been ignored by our media  and silenced by special interests.""
 He  still stood behind  his  call for ""the construction of a great wall along our Southern border"" to curb unauthorized immigrants  though  he  omitted a line from  his  prepared remarks that promised it would start ahead of schedule.
 Trump  didn't offer a specific defense of  his  controversial travel ban that affected seven Muslim-majority countries and was later halted by a federal court.  The administration  is expected to issue a new executive order this week.
But  he  did offer a broader  more muted than usual  pushback to the order's critics  saying that ""it is not compassionate  but reckless  to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.""
 Trump  still did have some of  his  usual bombast  though it was far more muted. Instead of boasting about how the political pundits had underestimated  him  and crowing about  his  electoral win  the president instead sought to harness the movement that had surprisingly thrust  him  into office.
""The rebellion started as a quiet protest  spoken by families of all colors and creeds â families who just wanted a fair shot for their children  and a fair hearing for their concerns  "" Trump  said. ""But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus â as thousands of citizens now spoke out together  from cities small and large  all across our country.","Calling For 'Renewal Of  The American Spirit ' Trump Outlines  [TGT]

5105,A Year After He Was Elected What's Changed Under President Trump ?,Trump,"A lot has changed in the year since  Donald Trump  was elected president  but some things remain pretty much the same. As we mark the first anniversary of that election  NPR's Scott Horsley looks at the impact  Trump  has had on Washington policymaking and at the policies that remain stubbornly resistant to change.
SCOTT HORSLEY  BYLINE: During the presidential campaign   Donald Trump  often promised to bring big change to Washington almost overnight.
 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : We're going to rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions.
 TRUMP : ...And elect a Republican Congress  we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare - have to do it.
HORSLEY: OK. We know that last one turned out to be a little more complicated than the president expected. Change in Washington often comes slowly - just ask former President Obama. Despite his dire warnings during the campaign about what a  Trump  victory would mean  Obama told The New Yorker shortly after the election he expected much of his legacy would survive.
HORSLEY: Obamacare is not the only piece of the last president's agenda that's proven hard for  Trump  to undo. Although  Trump  announced with considerable fanfare  his  intent to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement  that turns out to be a multiyear-long process. Even  Trump 's selection of a new Federal Reserve chairman last week was mostly a signal of continuity.
HORSLEY: Jason Furman was an economic adviser in the Obama White House. Some  Trump  efforts have run into legal roadblocks  like the proposed ban on transgender service members. In other important ways  though   Trump  has begun leaving  his  mark. Senior Vice President Neil Bradley of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says  Trump  has led the biggest rollback of regulations since Ronald Reagan  a move that's been welcomed by many of the chamber's members.
HORSLEY: Immigration is another area where the election's had big consequences.  Trump  has slashed the number of refugees the U.S. takes in. Deportations from the nation's interior have jumped 34 percent since  Trump  took office. John Malcolm of The Heritage Foundation says immigration officers are now casting a much wider net.
JOHN MALCOLM: There is no question that  President Trump  ran on a get tough on immigration stance. And I think you're already seeing that in terms of the number of deportations  and also the number of people who are attempting to enter our country.
HORSLEY:  Trump 's EPA has also begun the lengthy process of lifting restrictions on greenhouse gases from power plants. Kate Larsen  who monitors carbon pollution for the Rhodium Group  says that move won't be felt right away  but it will make a difference 5 or 10 years from now.
HORSLEY:  Trump  has also rattled foreign policy circles with provocative rhetoric  calling the Iran nuclear deal an embarrassment  for example  and threatening to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Congress and  his  own advisers have tried to sand off some of the president's rougher edges  but the rest of the world has taken notice. Derek Chollet of the German Marshall Fund says if  Trump  follows through on a narrowly defined America-first agenda  other countries will go their own way.
HORSLEY: During the president's Asia trip  for example  other countries will relaunch their effort to forge an Asia-Pacific trade pact minus the United States. Meanwhile  one of the biggest changes on the president's drawing board is the tax overhaul. That measure could have a dramatic effect on business  government coffers  the federal deficit and income inequality if it makes it through Congress.  Trump  has an ambitious timetable for the tax plan  hoping to sign it by the end of the year. But even if the ship of state moves more like Obama's ocean liner than a speedboat   Captain Trump  is determined to chart a very different course. Scott Horsley  NPR News.

As we mark the first anniversary of that election  NPR's Scott Horsley looks at the impact   [TGT]   has had on Washington policymaking and at the policies that remain stubbornly resistant to change.
SCOTT HORSLEY  BYLINE: During the presidential campaign    [TGT] often promised to bring big change to Washington almost overnight.

5107,Congressional Republicans in advanced talks to reduce the tax rate for top earners to 37 percent as part of final tax bill,Trump,"The moves were calculated to deliver Republicans a majority of votes in the House and Senate as lawmakers proceed on  an ambitious plan to produce a final tax bill this week and pass it by early next  sending it to President Trump for his signature by Christmas .
Late Tuesday   the emerging plan  faced immediate blowback when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) tweeted that it was wrong for negotiators to reject his plan to expand tax benefits for working families as âanti-growthâ when they were fine âto cut tax for couples making $1 million.â
GOP aides stressed that no changes would be final until the legislation has formally been filed  which lawmakers are aiming to do on Friday. Lawmakers plan to hold their only public event to discuss the bill Wednesday  and  Trump  plans to give  his  âclosing argumentâ for the tax bill Wednesday at the White House.  He  will be joined by five families from around the country.
Some close to Trump have warned about the public perception of designing the tax package in a way that appears to cater to the wealthy. Former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon had recommended internally that they consider a 44 percent tax bracket for income over $5 million  but his idea was shot down by others in the White House who said all tax rates needed to come down  even for the wealthy  to spur more economic growth.
After the House and Senate passed their versions of the tax bill  complaints from wealthy Americans â particularly in New York â grew louder  as they believed their taxes could actually go up under the new legislation. Thatâs because the tax bills would limit the ability to deduct state and local income taxes  among other changes  making it harder for the wealthy to lower their taxable income.  Trump  has received an earful from friends and supporters in New York  and last week signaled that  he  could support changes that  he  said would help a âsliverâ of people.
Both bills included as their central feature a massive reduction in the current 35 percent tax rate down to 20 percent.  Trump  had insisted for weeks that  he  would not allow anything above a 20 percent rate  but in recent days the White House has showed more flexibility as they tried to help lawmakers get a deal across the finish line.","The moves were calculated to deliver Republicans a majority of votes in the House and Senate as lawmakers proceed on  an ambitious plan to produce a final tax bill this week and pass it by early next  sending it to  [TGT]  for  [TGT]  signature by Christmas .

5108,Poll: NFL players' protests are appropriate; Trump's comments aren't,Trump,"WASHINGTON â Most Americans say the protests by NFL players during the National Anthem are appropriate  a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds  and they say  by overwhelming margins  that  President Trump 's heated criticism of them are not.
Two-thirds in the poll of registered voters  by 68%-27%  say  Trump 's call for NFL owners to fire the players and fans to boycott their games is inappropriate. That includes a third of Republicans as well as nine of 10 Democrats.
The survey  taken Wednesday through Sunday by landline and cell phone  shows how much attention the silent protest has commanded in recent weeks. Just 8% of those surveyed didn't have an opinion about the players' protests. Even fewer  5%  were undecided about  Trump 's criticism of them.
On Sunday  NFL players across the nation took a knee or linking arms during the National Anthem to demonstrate against  Trump 's comment that team owners should fire any ""son of a bitch"" who ""disrespects our flag."" Some fans booed them.
Protests muted week after NFL responds to  Trump  criticism

 Trump  on anthem protests: NFL owners 'afraid' of  their  players
 The protests  have broadened in recent weeks since quarterback Colin Kaepernick began dropping to one knee during the anthem last year to highlight police brutality and racial discrimination.
Mike Conklin  49  of Mesa  Arizona  an automotive technician and  Trump  supporter  scoffs at the idea of highly paid professional athletes spotlighting the issue of police brutality.
""These guys are making millions of dollars  and to say there's inequality with the police department is an absolute joke "" he says. "" Trump  played the NFL like a fiddle and showed what true un-Americans these people are.""
A third of those polled  33%  say  the protests  make them less likely to attend a game or watch it on TV. Seven percent say it makes them more likely to watch a game  but most  56%  say it wouldn't have any impact.
About eight in 10 Democrats saw the players' protests as appropriate; eight in 10 Republicans call them inappropriate. More than nine in 10 Democrats call  Trump 's comments inappropriate; a 57% majority of Republicans say they are appropriate.
Corinthia Morgan  21  a student and political independent from the Dallas suburb of Lancaster  says  Trump  should be worried about other issues.
""I think  he  needs to focus on the people who are dying in Puerto Rico and the Virgin island "" she says.

5109,US relations with Venezuela conflict between Trump and Nicolas Maduro,Donald Trump,"Many countries have  over the past few weeks  taken a ""wait and see"" approach to relations with the US government under President Donald Trump  perhaps none more so than Venezuela.
Venezuela's relations with the US have been contentious for much of the last 20 years  but Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro appears to hold out some hope ties could be better with  Trump .
Venezuela has been close to Russia under Vladimir Putin  whom  Trump  has spoken highly of  and this week  when the US slapped sanctions on Maduro's vice president  Venezuela's response appeared to avoid mentioning  Trump  by name  perhaps in an effort to keep open the possibility of improved dealings.
Deploying these sanctions now ""can be seen as the opening salvo of the  Trump  administration in dealing with Latin America's deepest crisis "" Michael Shifter  president of the Washington  DC-based policy group Inter-American Dialogue  told The New York Times.
That impression is bolstered by  Trump 's recent actions.
During a call on Wednesday   Trump  and Argentine President Mauricio Macri shared mutual ""concern"" over the situation in Venezuela.
Just hours after  Trump  spoke with Macri  he met in the Oval Office with Lilian Tintori  wife of Leopoldo Lopez  a hardline Venezuelan opposition leader jailed on trumped-up charges related to weeks of deadly anti-government protests in Venezuela in 2014.
At the conclusion of the meeting  which Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio also attended   Trump  tweeted  ""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez  a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori (just met w/ @marcorubio) out of prison immediately "" including a photo of the group.
Tintori is not the first Venezuelan opposition figure to visit the Oval Office  but  Trump 's statement after the meeting is a departure from the typically muted posture the US government took toward Venezuela under Obama.
""The Bolivarian Republic [of] Venezuela rejects the intrusion and aggression of [US President] @realDonaldTrump [who intends] to give orders to our homeland "" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez tweeted in response to  Trump . ""It is lamentable that lobbies and Miami mafias in complicity with the violent Venezuelan opposition impose on @realDonaldTrump policies against Venezuela.""
While  Trump 's broader approach to Venezuela  and Latin America in general  remains unclear  his seeming endorsement of the country's political opposition may amount to little.
Many in Venezuela and abroad support Lopez's release  and Maduro currently commands the approval of only about 20% of the public. But  Trump  is a widely disliked figure in the region.  His  support may not inspire many of Lopez's backers or bring more people to the opposition's ranks. (It may also further solidify support within the government for Maduro.)
Nor are reprimands from  Trump  likely to cut Venezuela off from  its  neighbors and partners.
""Despite  its  standing in Mercosur  the Venezuelan government isn't isolated "" Tim Gill  a post-doctoral fellow at Tulane University focused on Venezuela's foreign relations  told Business Insider  adding:
 Trump  has taken a hardline on Venezuela since the latter days of  his  campaign. While the members of  his  transition team focused on Latin America suggest that hardline will continue  the substance of  Trump 's position toward the the country  like many other policies  remains to be seen.","Many countries have  over the past few weeks  taken a ""wait and see"" approach to relations with the US government under  [TGT] perhaps none more so than Venezuela.

5110,Obama ran out of words on mass shootings. Trump has struggled to find them.,Trump,"As he heads to Florida this weekend   President Trump  is following in the footsteps of former president Barack Obama  a man  he  disparages and a leader whose time in office in many ways came to be defined by mass shootings.
All the while  Obama traveled a path from empathy and promises of action to anger and  ultimately  defeat. âI am not naive â Obama said in Dallas. âI have seen how inadequate my own words have been. â
Trump   beginning the second year of  his  presidency with  his  third major mass shooting  has a different problem.  His  challenges when it comes to connecting with a grieving public are often both personal and political.
While Obama simply ran out of things to say about the nationâs unending string of gun tragedies   Trump  â who often strains to express empathy â has struggled to find much to say about them at all.
In a statement from the White House on Thursday morning about the deadly school shooting in Parkland  Fla.   Trump  promised to work with state and local leaders to âtackle the difficult issue of mental health.â
But  his  remarks  which lasted about six minutes  were so generic that they could have applied to any catastrophe.
âTo every parent  teacher and child who is hurting so badly  we are here for you  whatever you need  whatever we can do to ease your pain â  he  said  reading from a script in a practiced monotone in the Diplomatic Room of the White House. âWe are all joined together as one American family  and your suffering is our burden also.â
[In response to shooting   Trump  calls suspect âmentally disturbed â does not mention gun control]
The comments mirrored what  he  said in September after the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Louisiana.
âWhen one American suffers â and I say this quite a bit  especially lately  when you see whatâs going on â we all suffer â  Trump  said in the stormâs aftermath. âWeâre one American family brought together in times of tragedy by the unbreakable bonds of love and loyalty that we have for one another.
And they struck a discordant tone with  his  presidency so far.  His  call to âanswer hate with loveâ and âcruelty with kindnessâ came from a president who responds to criticism by punching back â10 times harder â as  his  wife once said  and who takes pride in demeaning rivals with insulting nicknames.

Trumpâs most genuine emotion â the one that attracted legions of followers to his presidential campaign â is his anger  aides say.
âWe got elected on âDrain the Swamp â âLock Her Up â âBuild a Wall â â Stephen K. Bannon   Trumpâs  former chief strategist  said in a recent interview. âAnger and fear is what gets people to the polls.â
But anger has seemed off-limits for  Trump  when it comes to the root causes of mass shootings and the unwillingness to act in Washington. Polls suggest widespread support for gun-control legislation  but  Trump  has remained loyal to supporters who believed that Obama was trying to take away their guns. Instead  he has repeatedly pointed to mental illness as the cause of mass killings  including the one in Florida  though his administration has moved to cut spending on such care.
On the campaign trail   Trump  had a unique ability to connect with voters  presenting  himself  as someone who understood their problems and was fighting for them. Those connections have been tougher for  him  to forge as president â especially on issues such as gun control where  he  is out of step with most of the country.","As he heads to Florida this weekend    [TGT] is following in the footsteps of former president Barack Obama  a man   [TGT]   disparages and a leader whose time in office in many ways came to be defined by mass shootings.

5111,Grand Jury Indicts Russians Linked To Interference In 2016 Election : NPR,Trump,"Some of the people described in the court documents even traveled to the United States or ""communicated with unwitting individuals associated with [ President Trump 's campaign] and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities "" the indictment says.
 Trump  tweeted on Friday shortly after the indictment was handed up that it proved that there was ""no collusion"" between  his  campaign and Russian agents.
The president's tweet also seems to accept that there was some degree of Russian interference. However   Trump  has  at times  doubted that there were any efforts by Russians to influence the 2016 election  which Friday's indictment clearly outlines in rich  lengthy detail. He has called media reports and other discussion of the Russian interference campaign a ""hoax"" and ""fake news."" And last month the administration decided not to impose new sanctions on Russia despite a law passed by Congress.
 Trump 's personal lawyer  John M. Dowd  also said in an email that  he  was ""Very happy for the country. Bob and his team did a great job!""
The social media accounts run by the Russian defendants supported  Trump  and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont  Clinton's chief primary rival for the Democratic nomination  the indictment alleges. In addition to Clinton  Russian accounts also denigrated Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio  who challenged  Trump  for the GOP nomination.
There were also efforts beyond influencing the election to simply sow discord and confusion. For example  defendants allegedly organized both pro-Trump and anti-Trump rallies in New York City.
""While it does not include an allegation that any U.S. persons conspired wittingly with the Russian actors  the indictment leaves open the vital question of whether Americans  including any associated with the  Trump  campaign  knowingly played a role in Russia's active measures campaign "" Schiff also said in a statement.
House Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  who has been more accepting of evidence of Russian interference than  Trump  has  said the ""announcement underscores why we need to follow the facts and work to protect the integrity of future elections.""
Sen. Ben Sasse  R-Neb.  a frequent  Trump  critic  said the Mueller indictments ""just put Moscow on notice.""
And Friday afternoon  John Brennan  who was CIA director during the Obama administration from 2013-2017  tweeted that the ""DOJ statement and indictments reveal the extent and motivations of Russian interference in 2016 election."" Brennan  who has been a frequent critic of  Trump   also said  ""Claims of 'hoax' in tatters.""","Some of the people described in the court documents even traveled to the United States or ""communicated with unwitting individuals associated with [ President Trump 's campaign] and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities "" the indictment says.

Trump has informed Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas that he intends to relocate the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (Photo: RONEN ZVULUN / POOL  EPA-EFE)
WASHINGTON â  President Trump  will announce Wednesday that  he  is beginning the process of moving the American Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of  his  presidency so far.
Until the new embassy opens  the officials said   Trump  will continue to waive the Jerusalem Embassy Act. That 1995 law that requires the president to move the embassy to Jerusalem  or else give Congress a notice every six months that it's not in the national security interest of the United States to do so.
It's that waiver forcing  Trump 's hand this week.  Trump  waived the embassy move in June;  his  second waiver was due on Monday.
Trump  who prides  himself  on  his  negotiating skills  has been seeking what  he  calls ""one of the toughest deals of all"" â an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that would finally end decades of failed and frustrating diplomacy.
The officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of  Trump 's official announcement  said the president would portray the move as an acknowledgement of a historical and political fact: That Jerusalem has always been Israel's capital city and seat of government.
In his address from the White House Wednesday   Trump  will also signal to the Arab world that he remains committed to the Middle East peace process  the officials said.  Trump  will say  he 's still open to a two-state solution that would have Israel and Palestine coexist as separate nations  and that existing borders should be respected until a final agreement.

5115,FBI Agent Kicked,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â A veteran FBI counterintelligence agent was removed from special counsel Robert Muellerâs team investigating Russian election meddling after the discovery of an exchange of text messages seen as  potentially anti-President Donald Trump  a person familiar with the matter  said Saturday.
The swift removal almost certainly reflected a desire to insulate the investigators from any claims of political bias or favoritism.  Trump  and many of  his  supporters have at times sought to discredit the investigation  in part by claiming a close relationship between Mueller and fired FBI Director James Comey and by pointing to political contributions to Democratic candidates made by some lawyers on the team.
Mueller has been investigating whether  Trump  campaign associates coordinated with Russia to influence the o+utcome of the 2016 presidential election  and Strzokâs background in counterintelligence would have been seen as particularly valuable for a secretive FBI probe examining foreign contacts.
On Saturday   Trump  tweeted that he âhad to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!â
The tweet suggests that  Trump  was aware when  he  dismissed Flynn on Feb. 13 that  he  had lied to the FBI  which had interviewed  him  weeks earlier.  Comey  has said that  Trump  the following day brought up the Flynn investigation in private at the White House and told  him  that  he  hoped  he  could âlet this go.â
The nature of the messages Strzok exchanged and with whom  he  communicated was not immediately clear.

5117,Trump choosing white men as judges highest rate in decades,Trump,"President Donald Trump is nominating white men to America's federal courts at a rate not seen in nearly 30 years  threatening to reverse a slow transformation toward a judiciary that reflects the nation's diversity.
So far  91 percent of  Trump 's nominees are white  and 81 percent are male  an Associated Press analysis has found. Three of every four are white men  with few African-Americans and Hispanics in the mix. The last president to nominate a similarly homogenous group was George H.W. Bush.
The shift could prove to be one of  Trump 's most enduring legacies. These are lifetime appointments  and  Trump  has inherited both an unusually high number of vacancies and an aging population of judges. That puts  him  in position to significantly reshape the courts that decide thousands of civil rights  environmental  criminal justice and other disputes across the country. The White House has been upfront about its plans to quickly fill the seats with conservatives  and has made clear that judicial philosophy tops any concerns about shrinking racial or gender diversity.
 Trump  is anything but shy about  his  plans  calling  his  imprint on the courts an ""untold story"" of  his  presidency.
Comparing the first ten months of judicial appointments by  former President Barack Obama vs. Trump .
""Nobody wants to talk about it ""  he  says. ""But when you think of it ... that has consequences 40 years out.""  He  predicted at a recent Cabinet meeting  ""A big percentage of the court will be changed by this administration over a very short period of time.""
One court that has become a focus in the debate is the Eastern District of North Carolina  a region that  despite its sizeable black population  has never had a black judge. A seat on that court has been open for more than a decade. George W. Bush named a white man  and  Barack Obama  at different points nominated two black women  but none of those nominees ever came to a vote in the Senate.
 Trump  has renominated Bush's original choice: Thomas Farr  a private attorney whose work defending North Carolina's redistricting maps and a voter identification law has raised concerns among civil rights advocates.
In recent decades  Democrats have consistently named more racial minorities and women on the courts. But even compared to his Republican predecessors   Trump 's nominees stand out. So far  he has nominated the highest percentage of white judges in his first year since Ronald Reagan. If he continues on his trend through his first term  he will be the first Republican since Herbert Hoover to name fewer women and minorities to the court than his GOP predecessor.
Some of Obama's efforts were thwarted by a Republican-led Senate that blocked all of his nominations he made in the final year of his presidency  handing  Trump  a backlog of more than 100 open seats and significant sway over the future of the court.
 Trump  has moved aggressively to name new judges  getting off to a much quicker start than  his  predecessors.  He  has nominated more than twice as many as Obama had at this point in  his  presidency. While there have been clashes in the Senate over the nomination process  Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled that he is committed to moving judicial nominees through.
Many of  Trump 's white  male nominees would replace white  male judges. But of the  Trump  nominees currently pending  more than a quarter are white males slated for seats have been held by women or minorities.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley says  Trump  is focused on qualifications and suggests that prioritizing diversity would bring politics to the bench.
"" The president  has delivered on  his  promise to nominate the best  most-qualified judges "" Gidley said. ""While past presidents may have chosen to nominate activist judges with a political agenda and a history of legislating from the bench   President Trump  has nominated outstanding originalist judges who respect the U.S. Constitution.""
 Trump   who has cited the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch as a key achievement  has focused on judges with conservative resumes.  His  picks have been welcomed by conservative legal groups.
Leonard Leo  the executive vice president of the Federalist Society who has advised  Trump  on judges  said  the president 's judicial picks should be evaluated based on  his  nominations to the Supreme Court and appellate courts  given that home-state senators traditionally offer recommendations for district courts that carry significant weight when the lawmaker and  the president  are of the same party.","[TGT]  is nominating white men to America's federal courts at a rate not seen in nearly 30 years  threatening to reverse a slow transformation toward a judiciary that reflects the nation's diversity.
So far  91 percent of  Trump 's nominees are white  and 81 percent are male  an Associated Press analysis has found. Three of every four are white men  with few African-Americans and Hispanics in the mix. The last president to nominate a similarly homogenous group was George H.W. Bush.
The shift could prove to be one of  Trump 's most enduring legacies. These are lifetime appointments  and   [TGT] has inherited both an unusually high number of vacancies and an aging population of judges. That puts  him  in position to significantly reshape the courts that decide thousands of civil rights  environmental  criminal justice and other disputes across the country. The White House has been upfront about its plans to quickly fill the seats with conservatives  and has made clear that judicial philosophy tops any concerns about shrinking racial or gender diversity.
  [TGT] is anything but shy about   [TGT]   plans  calling   [TGT]   imprint on the courts an ""untold story"" of   [TGT]   presidency.
Comparing the first ten months of judicial appointments by  former President Barack Obama vs.  [TGT]  .
""Nobody wants to talk about it ""  he  says. ""But when you think of it ... that has consequences 40 years out.""  He  predicted at a recent Cabinet meeting  ""A big percentage of the court will be changed by this administration over a very short period of time.""
One court that has become a focus in the debate is the Eastern District of North Carolina  a region that  despite its sizeable black population  has never had a black judge. A seat on that court has been open for more than a decade. George W. Bush named a white man  and  Barack Obama  at different points nominated two black women  but none of those nominees ever came to a vote in the Senate.
  [TGT] has renominated Bush's original choice: Thomas Farr  a private attorney whose work defending North Carolina's redistricting maps and a voter identification law has raised concerns among civil rights advocates.
In recent decades  Democrats have consistently named more racial minorities and women on the courts. But even compared to his Republican predecessors    [TGT]  's nominees stand out. So far  he has nominated the highest percentage of white judges in his first year since Ronald Reagan. If he continues on his trend through his first term  he will be the first Republican since Herbert Hoover to name fewer women and minorities to the court than his GOP predecessor.
Some of Obama's efforts were thwarted by a Republican-led Senate that blocked all of his nominations he made in the final year of his presidency  handing   [TGT] a backlog of more than 100 open seats and significant sway over the future of the court.
  [TGT] has moved aggressively to name new judges  getting off to a much quicker start than   [TGT]   predecessors.   [TGT]   has nominated more than twice as many as Obama had at this point in   [TGT]   presidency. While there have been clashes in the Senate over the nomination process  Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled that he is committed to moving judicial nominees through.
Many of  Trump 's white  male nominees would replace white  male judges. But of the   [TGT]   nominees currently pending  more than a quarter are white males slated for seats have been held by women or minorities.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley says   [TGT] is focused on qualifications and suggests that prioritizing diversity would bring politics to the bench.
"" The president  has delivered on  his  promise to nominate the best  most-qualified judges "" Gidley said. ""While past presidents may have chosen to nominate activist judges with a political agenda and a history of legislating from the bench   President Trump  has nominated outstanding originalist judges who respect the U.S. Constitution.""

5120,Is North Korea Really a 'State Sponsor of Terrorism'? Â» Alex Jones' Infowars: There's a war on for your mind!,Trump,"President Trump  announced last week that  he  was returning North Korea to the US list of âstate sponsors of terrorismâ after having been off the list for the past nine years. Americans may wonder what dramatic event led  the US president  to re-designate North Korea as a terrorism-sponsoring nation. Has Pyongyang been found guilty of some spectacular terrorist attack overseas or perhaps of plotting to overthrow another country by force? No  that is not the case. North Korea is back on the US list of state sponsors of terrorism because  President Trump  thinks the move will convince the government to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile program.  He  believes that continuing down the path toward confrontation with North Korea will lead the country to capitulate to Washingtonâs demands. That will not happen.
President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued that North Korea deserved to be back on the list because the North Korean government is reported to have assassinated a North Korean citizen â Kim Jong-Unâs own half-brother â in February at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. But what does that say about Washingtonâs own program to assassinate US citizens like Anwar al-Awlaki and his 16 year old son under Obama  and later Awlakiâs six year old daughter under  Trump ? Like Kimâs half brother  Awlaki and his two children were never tried or convicted of a crime before being killed by their own government.
The neocons  who are pushing for a war with North Korea  are extremely pleased by Trumpâs move. John Bolton called it âexactly the right thing to do.â
Designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism will allow  President Trump  to impose the âhighest level of sanctionsâ on North Korea. Does anyone believe more sanctions â which hurt the suffering citizens of North Korea the most â will actually lead North Koreaâs leadership to surrender to Washingtonâs demands? Sanctions never work. They hurt the weakest and most vulnerable members of society the hardest and affect the elites the least.
So North Korea is officially a terrorism-sponsoring nation according to the Trump Administration because Kim Jong-Un killed a family member. Meanwhile  Saudi Arabia is in the process of killing the entire country of Yemen and no one says a word. In fact  the US government has just announced it will sell Saudi Arabia $7 billion more weapons to help it finish the job.","[TGT] announced last week that   [TGT]   was returning North Korea to the US list of âstate sponsors of terrorismâ after having been off the list for the past nine years.

5121,What Do Jotted Talking Points Say About Trumpâs Empathy?,Trump,"Still  consoler in chief has been a role that the president has been slow and somewhat reluctant to embrace â especially in contrast to his predecessor. Images of Mr. Trump hurling rolls of paper towels at hurricane victims in Puerto Rico last year and grinning broadly for photographs with emergency medical workers from Parkland have illustrated the challenge.
 Mr. Trump  has said  he  believes that understanding and channeling the nationâs grief is a strong suit for  him  as president  assuring a reporter during  his  campaign that empathy âwill be one of the strongest things about  Trump .â
Ms. Fuentes  who was left with a piece of shrapnel lodged behind her right eye  said  Mr. Trump  had called the gunman a âsick puppyâ and said ââoh boy  oh boy  oh boy â like  seven times.â
The account of the call was reminiscent of the last time  Mr. Trump  drew public scrutiny for  his  reaction to a tragedy  with  his  private condolence call to Myeshia Johnson  the widow of Sgt. La David T. Johnson  one of four American soldiers killed in an attack in Niger.
In that case  in October  Ms. Johnson said she had been deeply offended by  Mr. Trump âs words and tone  saying that  he  had not referred to her husband by name  calling him only âyour guy â and had upset her by saying that Mr. Johnson âknew what he signed up for  but it hurts anyway.â
 Mr. Trump  quickly lashed out on Twitter  saying  he  had spoken respectfully to the widow.
Colleagues said Mr. Trumpâs notes on Wednesday were written by Hope Hicks   his  communications director and longtime aide  who had briefed the president along with Sarah Huckabee Sanders  the press secretary  before he attended the session.
In private beforehand   Mr. Trump  met in the Oval Office with Andrew Pollack  whose 18-year-old daughter  Meadow  was one of the 17 people killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last week.
â He  showed us nothing but love â Mr. Pollack said in an interview. â The guy  really cared  you know?  He  flew us in   he  had a bus waiting for us   he  made time for us.â
Mr. Pollack  who brought his wife  two sons and Meadowâs longtime boyfriend  said  Mr. Trump  signed  his  sonâs white and gold âMake America Great Againâ trucker hat and spoke at length with the family.  The president  insisted that  he  and  his  family  who had not planned to attend the listening session  accompany  him  through the iconic White House colonnade and into the event.
â He  took pictures of my daughter that we brought  and  he  said  he  was going to look at it every day â Mr. Pollack said.
â He  just said  âYou guys are coming with me â and we were just talking about life as we walked â Mr. Pollack said. â He âs a regular guy. I wouldnât have been there if I didnât think  he  cared.â
But another participant in the White House session  Samuel Zeif  an 18-year-old student at Stoneman Douglas High School who survived the shooting and spoke tearfully at the White House on Wednesday of the experience  said  Mr. Trump  had done little to comfort or console  him .
 He  said  he  had been particularly stung to see pictures of the notecard after it was over.
âEverything I said was directly from the heart  and  he  had to write down âI hear you ââ Mr. Zeif said in an interview. âHalf the time during that meeting  his arms were crossed â I kept wanting to say  âMr. President  uncross your arms.â To me  that is the international sign for closemindedness; itâs really just a big âno.ââ","Still  consoler in chief has been a role that the president has been slow and somewhat reluctant to embrace â especially in contrast to his predecessor.

5122,Is Trump Smart Enough To Reappoint Janet Yellen?,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump  would be wise to reappoint Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen  whose term expires in February. Keeping Yellen would plainly serve Trumpâs political interests. Yellenâs stewardship of the Fed has kept the recovery on track  stimulated inflation-free economic growth  and even permitted a little wage growth despite the wreckage of unions and the loss of labor power in the gig economy. The result is also record stock market levels.
Yellen is one of Obamaâs best appointees  and perhaps the best Fed chair ever. Thanks to Yellen   Trump  enjoys bragging rights for an economic boom not of  his  own making. So whatâs not to like?
For one thing  thereâs the inescapable  galling fact that  Trump âs nemesis  Barack Obama  appointed her. For another  Yellen is a liberal Democrat. And third  Yellen found the economic sweet spot by combining strong financial regulation with low interest rates. Tough regulation is not exactly Trumpâs thing.
So what will  Trump  do? The White House has signaled that  he  will appoint a Fed chair by early November. The smart move would be to rename Yellen.
 Trump  said  himself  in a Sunday interview broadcast on Fox that there were three names on  his  short listâYellen and two Republicans. One is Stanford economist John Taylor  the other is a current Fed governor  Jerome Powell  known as âJay.â Two other names that have been mentioned by White House sources are Gary Cohn  who heads the White House economic council  and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh.
So if  Trump  desires to shoot  himself  and the economy in the foot  either Taylor or Warsh would do the job nicely. Presumably  even with  Trumpâs  short attention span and erratic impulses  Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin will point that out.
Investors are enjoying the steep run-up in stock prices  and waiting for a signal that a âcorrectionâ is about to begin  in which case large numbers of stockholders will cash in their winnings  causing the sharp fall in stock prices that they fear. The day that  Trump  appoints Taylor or Warsh  look for an abrupt stock market lurch  followed by slower growth triggered by higher interest rates.
The wise guys say that Cohn is out of  the runningâTrump  needs him at the White House. Supposedly  the favorite is Powell.
Powell personifies the swamp that  Trump  pledged to clean out. Basically  heâs Yellen on monetary policy and Greenspan on non-regulation  risking another bubble and collapse. In the  Trump  era  heâs as good as it gets.
It sure looks to me as if Yellen was included on the short list as a feint. This is standard  Trump  practice.

5123,Trump administration approves lethal arms sales to Ukraine,Trump,"Correction: A previous version of this blog post incorrectly reported that  the Trump administration  had approved the first-ever commercial sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine.  It  stated that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had publicly supported arms sales to Ukraine; Mattis did not explicitly do so. This post has been updated.
 The Trump administration  has approved the largest U.S. commercial sale of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine since 2014. The move was heavily supported by top  Trump  national security Cabinet officials and Congress but may complicate President Trumpâs stated ambition to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Congress authorized such sales in 2014 in the Ukraine Freedom Support Act  but the Obama administration never authorized large commercial or government sales  a move widely seen as a de facto decision not to provide lethal weapons to the Ukraine military. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)  who co-sponsored the law  praised the Trump administrationâs move.
 Another senior Trump administration official  said that  Trump  personally approved the decision to allow the issuing of the license after being presented a decision memo by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. While there was never a formal ban on such weapons transfers  the decision was discussed internally as a lifting of the de facto Obama administration restrictions   the official  said.
As I reported in October  the decision over whether to allow lethal arms sales to Ukraine had been sitting on  Trumpâs  desk for months. The National Security Councilâs Principals Committee  which includes Cabinet members  met months ago and provided several options to the president.
Experts and officials said  Trumpâs  chosen option was measured;  he  didnât approve everything the Ukrainians asked for but nonetheless crossed the line of approving lethal sales  a significant shift in  his  administrationâs approach and U.S. policy overall.
The  Trump  administration notified leading congressional committees of the sale on Dec. 13 but didnât make any public announcements  which some say reflects the sensitivity of the decision and concern about how it will be received by  Trump  supporters who long opposed the move  as well as by Putin.
Itâs unclear whether Hill still holds that view  but  other top Trump officials  have been clear  they  support sending lethal arms to Ukraine. Mattis said in Kiev in August that âdefensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor  and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor.â Tillerson declared his support in his Senate confirmation hearing.
Trump himself has consistently stated his desire to work with Putin to resolve the Ukraine crisis  dating back to his presidential campaign.
During the 2016 GOP convention  the  Trump  campaign beat back efforts to have the Republican platform endorse lethal assistance to Ukraine.  Trump  campaign officials pushed to soften a proposed amendment to remove the language âlethal defensive weaponsâ and replace it with âappropriate assistance.â
 Trump  has now decided that lethal defensive weapons constitute âappropriate assistance.â His decision to approve small amounts of weapons sales likely wonât fundamentally change Putinâs calculus or the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. But itâs one sure sign that  Trumpâs  foreign policy views are evolving â or at least being influenced â as his presidency progresses.","Correction: A previous version of this blog post incorrectly reported that   [TGT] had approved the first-ever commercial sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine.

  [TGT] has approved the largest U.S. commercial sale of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine since 2014. The move was heavily supported by top   [TGT]   national security Cabinet officials and Congress but may complicate President Trumpâs stated ambition to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Congress authorized such sales in 2014 in the Ukraine Freedom Support Act  but  [TGT]  never authorized large commercial or government sales  a move widely seen as a de facto decision not to provide lethal weapons to the Ukraine military. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.)  who co-sponsored the law  praised the Trump administrationâs move.
  [TGT] said that   [TGT] personally approved the decision to allow the issuing of the license after being presented a decision memo by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. While there was never a formal ban on such weapons transfers  the decision was discussed internally as a lifting of the de facto Obama administration restrictions    [TGT] said.
As I reported in October  the decision over whether to allow lethal arms sales to Ukraine had been sitting on  Trumpâs  desk for months. The National Security Councilâs Principals Committee  which includes Cabinet members  met months ago and provided several options to the president.
Experts and officials said   [TGT] chosen option was measured;   [TGT]   didnât approve everything the Ukrainians asked for but nonetheless crossed the line of approving lethal sales  a significant shift in  his  administrationâs approach and U.S. policy overall.
 [TGT]  notified leading congressional committees of the sale on Dec. 13 but  [TGT]  make any public announcements  which some say reflects the sensitivity of the decision and concern about how it will be received by   [TGT]   supporters who long opposed the move  as well as by Putin.
Itâs unclear whether Hill still holds that view  but   [TGT] have been clear   [TGT]   support sending lethal arms to Ukraine. Mattis said in Kiev in August that âdefensive weapons are not provocative unless you are an aggressor  and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor.â Tillerson declared his support in his Senate confirmation hearing.
Trump himself has consistently stated his desire to work with Putin to resolve the Ukraine crisis  dating back to his presidential campaign.
During the 2016 GOP convention  the   [TGT] campaign beat back efforts to have the Republican platform endorse lethal assistance to Ukraine.   [TGT] campaign officials pushed to soften a proposed amendment to remove the language âlethal defensive weaponsâ and replace it with âappropriate assistance.â
  [TGT] has now decided that lethal defensive weapons constitute âappropriate assistance.â  [TGT]  decision to approve small amounts of weapons sales likely  [TGT]  fundamentally change Putinâs calculus or the trajectory of the war in Ukraine. But itâs one sure sign that  Trumpâs  foreign policy views are evolving â or at least being influenced â as  [TGT]  presidency progresses.",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,,,,,

 President Trump  directed the Department of Justice on Tuesday to look at crafting regulations that would ban gun accessories that ""turn legal weapons into machine guns "" including the so-called bump stocks used in the Las Vegas mass shooting.
 Trump 's announcement comes as the White House is facing increased pressure after the Florida school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  where 17 people were killed. The mass shooting has once again reignited the national debate surrounding gun control.

 Donald Trump  has taken a major victory lap over Britain's vote Thursday to leave the European Union  saying during a visit to  his  Scotland golf course that people of the United Kingdom ""want to take their country back.""  He  also said there was ""a big parallel"" between the so-called Brexit vote and American anger over globalization â the growing spread of trade and business ties among countries across the globe.
""They want to take their borders back. They want to take their monetary [sic] back. They want to take a lot of things back ""  Trump  said Friday. ""They want to be able to have a country again. So  I think youâre going have  his  happen more and more. I really believe that  and I think itâs happening in the United States.â
Here are key moments from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's answers to reporters' questions June 24 at  his  golf course in Scotland. (Reuters)
 Trump  has built  his  campaign â and secured  his  spot as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee â largely by aligning  himself  with voter unrest over free trade.  He  has slammed American companies for moving manufacturing jobs to countries such as China and Mexico.
But in  his  decades as a dealmaker and businessman   Trump  has routinely made money from outsourced labor  overseas manufacturing and other planks of the free-trade policy  he  has rallied against as a politician. Even today   Trump  and  his  businesses are rewarded handsomely for several lucrative deals  he  has made in the global marketplace â including manufacturing deals in China and Mexico.
Here are a few examples.  Trump 's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

1.  Trump 's signature merchandise  ""made in Bangladesh""
 Trump  built  his  career in real estate before moving into lucrative licensing deals  in which  Trump  makes money by agreeing to tack  his  name onto products as diverse as steaks  chocolate  bottled water and wine.
Today  much of  Trump 's merchandising empire â including his Donald J. Trump Collection dress shirts  suits  eyeÂ­glasses and perfume â is made in low-wage countries such as Bangladesh  China and Honduras. Hundreds of the products in the clothing and jewelry lines of  Trump 's daughter Ivanka are also made in China.
In 2004   Trump  struck a deal with Phillips-Van Heusen  the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein  that would direct factories in those Asian and South American countries to make  Trump  ties and tuxedo shirts.
In those factories  wages are low  worker protections are minimal  and labor-law violations such as forced overtime are routine. But a company official who helped  Trump  broker the deal said ""finding a company that made in America was never something""  Trump  said would be important.
 Trump  said in May that  his  products are made overseas because ""they donât even make them here anymore "" a claim that American clothing manufacturers say is false. At a Republican debate in March   Trump  also said  his  years of experience in outsourcing would help  him  correct the policies that encourage similar overseas deals.

The move was in response to the decision by as many as 50 Democratic lawmakers who have reportedly invited dreamers and other undocumented immigrants to Trump's first State of the Union.
 Trump 's own record on protecting dreamers is mixed. While launching  his  presidential campaign   Trump  accused immigrants from Mexico of being rapists and murderers. The brief government shutdown earlier this month arguably happened in part because of  Trump 's reluctance or lack of clarity on what  he  wants for the dreamers. That  and  his  âshithole countriesâ comment.
Gosar's view of dreamers is inconsistent with that of most Americans  including many voters in  his  own party: The majority of Americans support protections for dreamers.
 The GOP under Trump  has been criticized  even from some within the Republican Party  of leaving the âcompassionate conservatismâ that former president George W. Bush campaigned on in the past.  GOP  lawmakers being silent about Gosar's suggestion risks giving the impression that Republicans don't even want dreamers present who are eager to hear  Trump 's vision for America. For a party that is struggling with Latino voters  Gosar's rhetoric probably doesn't move  the GOP  in the direction of winning more of  their  support. This aggressive approach to immigration reform could cause a party to lose votes in the midterm elections with the majority of Americans who are sympathetic to dreamers and their families.","[TGT] 's position on DACA has taken several twists and turns over the years.

5128,President Trump ' Wrong' To Call London Embassy Area An 'Off Location ' Residents Say : Parallels : NPR,Trump,"President Trump 'Wrong' To Call London Embassy Area An 'Off Location ' Residents Say
When  President Trump  announced Thursday that  he  was canceling  his  visit to the United Kingdom next month to open the new U.S. Embassy in London   he  sounded less like the leader of the world's most powerful country and more like the real estate developer  he  once was.
On Twitter   he  complained that the Obama administration (it was actually George W. Bush's) had traded an embassy located in one of the British capital's top districts  Mayfair  for a new one in ""an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! ""
Trump  was referring to the London borough of Wandsworth  south of the River Thames  which is now home to a massive development known as Nine Elms. Once a logistical hub for distributing fruit and vegetables  among other things  Nine Elms today is dotted with cranes and includes multimillion-dollar waterfront apartments.
""I thought he got it wrong "" said Ravi Govindia  leader of the Wandsworth Council  referring to  Trump 's implicit criticism of the area.
That may not be the only thing  Trump  got wrong. The embassy  in fact  cost about $1 billion  according to U.S. government officials.
""As a real estate person ... I think [President Trump] would see that there is always an opportunity in regenerating and redeveloping a site "" said Govindia. ""It may not look great to start with  but it is what you do with it that makes it great and that's where the opportunities and profit are.""
Behnejad says people in the neighborhood weren't offended by  Trump 's comments.
Jonathan Scobie  a real estate agent who sells property at Embassy Gardens  an apartment complex near the embassy  was excited for  Trump 's planned visit. He is also a big fan of the president and his blunt style.
Scobie doesn't agree with  Trump 's characterization of Nine Elms  but he says the attention generated by his tweet won't hurt.","President Trump 'Wrong' To Call London Embassy Area An 'Off Location ' Residents Say

5130,Trump in Asia : A beginner's guide to trade threats and tweets,Trump,"US President Donald Trump  is on  his  first official trip to Asia  passing through Japan  South Korea  China  Vietnam and the Philippines.
 Mr Trump  starts off by visiting Washington's closest Asian friends: Japan and South Korea. But it's North Korea they will be talking about. Pyongyang has already sent two long range missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth and biggest nuclear test. Despite harsher sanctions  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has shown no sign of slowing down the pace of weapons development. Skittish observers wonder if the visit will prompt Pyongyang to do something rash. But if talks with almost every leader are about how to deal with North Korea  there is unlikely to be any real consensus. Here are some key questions from this leg of the trip:
How much reassurance can  Trump  provide? With Japanese citizens rehearsing drills in case of a nuclear attack  Tokyo will want to know the US will provide military co-operation. Seoul  literally in the firing line of its northern neighbour with artillery positioned over the border  will want the same.
Will Trump tweet while so close to the North? After an unprecedented personal warning to  Mr Trump  from Kim Jong-un  Seoul will want  him  to tone down  his  rhetoric and keep options for dialogue open. Any threats exchanged when  he  is literally over the border won't go down well.
How will  he  like the viral Pen Pineapple song? In Tokyo  he  is also set to meet Piko Taro  singer of the Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen earworm that swept the globe.
What about that awkward handshake?  Mr Trump  and Japan's PM Shinzo Abe are thought to have a strong relationship  but people will watch closely after the patting and twitching of their last 19-second handshake.
China is North Korea's chief economic supporter and  Mr Trump  is likely to seek continued support for sanctions. But Chinese leader Xi Jinping has just emerged from a Communist Party Congress that saw his power reach unprecedented levels  so he may not feel the need to compromise. Few observers expect radical shifts in the US-China relationship  but they will be watching for any clues to shifts in the global balance of power. China set out its stall earlier this year with a push to its 2013 Belt and Road project  a vast global trade network with China at its heart. Here are other things to look out for:
Will he talk tough on trade?  Mr Trump  is known for lambasting China over allegedly unfair trade policies  currency manipulation and stealing US jobs.  He  has just called the US trade deficit with China ""embarrassing"" but what can  he  achieve in practice?
By the time  Mr Trump  gets to Vietnam and the Philippines we should know more about how the US is positioning itself in Asia. Trade is likely to be key.  Mr Trump  pulled out of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal  frustrating many including Vietnam   his  host at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' meeting. Even Japan and Korea are nervous the US will back off from bilateral trade agreements.  His  ""America First!"" slogan is aimed at a domestic audience but does not go down well with trade partners abroad. And there are other questions from this leg:
Will  he  speak out on human rights? Both Vietnam  which puts dissenting bloggers in jail  and the Philippines  with its controversial drug war  have a patchy rights record - but will  Mr Trump  speak out?
What happens when  Trump  and Duterte meet?  They  are the two most outspoken leaders in the world  so expect colourful talk. But Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has shown he is just as willing to woo China as the US  the Philippines' traditional ally.","[TGT] is on   [TGT]   first official trip to Asia  passing through Japan  South Korea  China  Vietnam and the Philippines.

But Chinese leader Xi Jinping has just emerged from a Communist Party Congress that saw his power reach unprecedented levels  so he may not feel the need to compromise. Few observers expect radical shifts in the US-China relationship  but they will be watching for any clues to shifts in the global balance of power. China set out its stall earlier this year with a push to its 2013 Belt and Road project  a vast global trade network with China at its heart. Here are other things to look out for:
Will he talk tough on trade?   [TGT] is known for lambasting China over allegedly unfair trade policies  currency manipulation and stealing US jobs.   [TGT]   has just called the US trade deficit with China ""embarrassing"" but what can   [TGT]   achieve in practice?
By the time   [TGT] gets to Vietnam and the Philippines we should know more about how the US is positioning itself in Asia. Trade is likely to be key.   [TGT] pulled out of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal  frustrating many including Vietnam    [TGT]   host at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' meeting. Even Japan and Korea are nervous the US will back off from bilateral trade agreements.   [TGT]   ""America First!"" slogan is aimed at a domestic audience but does not go down well with trade partners abroad. And there are other questions from this leg:
Will  he  speak out on human rights? Both Vietnam  which puts dissenting bloggers in jail  and the Philippines  with its controversial drug war  have a patchy rights record - but will   [TGT] speak out?
What happens when   [TGT] and Duterte meet?   [TGT]   are the two most outspoken leaders in the world  so expect colourful talk.

5131,Donald Trump's attempt to link UK crime stats to terrorism just wrong,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump  posted a tweet linking an increase in UK crime to ""Islamic terror.""
UK authorities have been very hesitant to engage with  Trump 's analysis.
In his daily morning tweetstorm   President Donald Trump  made the relatively unusual decision to go beyond the domestic news agenda and comment on the affairs of the United Kingdom.
As with much that  Trump  says   he  makes no concrete claims  but the implication is clear:  He  thinks that Islamic terrorism is the primary driver of this increase in crime.

But when pressed by Business Insider on whether their analysis tallies at all with  Trump 's  a spokesman said: ""I'm not aware of any comments to that effect.""
 Trump  would have been wiser to highlight Home Office figures released earlier this year  showing a record number of terror-related arrests.  It  also showed that 90% of detainees have what  it  called ""Islamist extremist views.""

5132,What the Manafort indictment proves about Trump (and what it doesn't),Trump,"(CNN) On Monday morning   former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort  was indicted on charges of money laundering and filing false foreign lobbying reports   among other counts.
The indictment  which was long expected  is the first example of charges filed by special counsel Bob Mueller  who is investigating Russia's attempted meddling in the 2016 election and whether any collusion occurred between the  Trump  campaign and the Russian government.
That  plus Manafort's lofty title and central role in  Trump 's campaign  makes it HUGE news. But  it's important to take a minute and detail what these charges against  Manafort  prove vis a vis  Trump's campaign  and what  they  don't.
Let's start with what the  Manafort  charges prove in regards Trump.
 Trump  hired  Manafort  in the spring of 2016 as  he  was working to beat back what was  at the time  seen as a likely delegate fight with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at the Republican National Convention.
 Manafort  had two things that  Trump  needed: A knowledge of establishment Washington and a willingness to work for  Trump . (Lots and lots of establishment Washington types -- even back then -- wouldn't go within a country mile of  Trump 's campaign.)
 Manafort  also had long been someone with a demonstrated willingness to work for controversial/authoritarian foreign leaders and businessmen with questionable pasts -- most notably with his involvement in Ukraine  where he represented pro-Russian interests.
No one -- and I mean no one -- in political Washington didn't know that about  Manafort . Which leads to one of two conclusions about  Trump  (neither of which are a terribly good look):
1) He knew about  Manafort 's sketchy past and didn't care -- or thought it was not a big deal
2) He didn't know about  Manafort 's sketchy past.
I'm not sure which one reflects more poorly on  Trump . In the first scenario  he's willing to overlook what had to be doubts raised by his advisers about the issues of bringing  Manafort  on in such a senior role. In the second   Trump  simply didn't do the research necessary when hiring someone at such a senior level.
Either way  the Manafort indictment -- along with that of Rick Gates  a Manafort protege who served as liaison between even the  Trump  campaign and the Republican National Committee even after  Manafort  was fired in August 2016 -- raises real questions about  Trump 's judgment in regard to staffing at the highest levels of not just  his  campaign but the federal government.
 Trump  repeatedly made  his  judgment an issue during the campaign. ""I'm going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people ""  Trump  told the Washington Post during the 2016 race. ""We want top of the line professionals.""
That quote seems a million miles away from  Manafort 's indictment.
Now to what  Manafort 's indictment doesn't mean for  Trump .
Remember that  Trump  has been adamant -- as recently as Sunday on Twitter -- that there is no proof (and there will be no proof) of collusion between  his  campaign and the Russians. Manafort's indictment deals specifically with financial dealings -- money laundering etc. -- and therefore allows  Trump  to insist that what Manafort did is all about Manafort and nothing about  Trump  or the 2016 campaign.","(CNN) On Monday morning   former  [TGT]  presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort  was indicted on charges of money laundering and filing false foreign lobbying reports   among other counts.

5134,Former 'Apprentice' contestant battles Trump in court,Donald Trump,"CLOSE A former cast member of the reality TV show 'The Apprentice' who has accused  Donald Trump  of unwanted sexual contact and has filed a New York defamation lawsuit against him has thanked her lawyers and says the case should go forward.

NEW YORK â The lawsuit filed against  President Trump  by a former contestant on The Apprentice who accused  him  of groping and then defaming her moved a step closer Tuesday to a decision on whether the case should go to trial.
In clashing court arguments  lawyers for Summer Zervos said she suffered threats after  Trump  publicly said she had ""made up"" her claims in a politically motivated effort to help Hillary Clinton beat  him  in the 2016 presidential race.
 Trump  ""cannot be allowed to attack a woman who has factually described  his  sexual groping and be allowed to get off scot-free "" argued Zervos attorney Mariann Meier Wang during the hour-long hearing before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter.
Marc Kasowitz   Trump 's personal lawyer  contended that  Trump  said nothing wrong while defending  himself . He also argued that the case cannot legally be tried in state court  and should be dismissed or at least delayed.
Citing the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause  he said  Trump 's motion to throw out the case ""has nothing to do with putting anyone above the law."" Instead  he said it was about ""protecting the ability of the president to do his constitutionally-mandated job.""
Zervos  who sat quietly in the lower Manhattan courtroom behind her attorneys  is among roughly a dozen women who publicly accused  Trump  of sexual misconduct during last year's presidential race. But she's the first to sue him.
Filed in January  her legal action alleges that  Trump  âambushedâ her more than once in 2007  six years before he was elected president  by kissing her on the mouth  touching her breast  and pressing his genitals against her.
Zervos also accused  Trump  of defaming her during campaign rallies and via Twitter  his favorite social media platform. At an Oct. 15  2016  campaign stop in Maine   Trump  alluded to Zervos by referring to ""false allegations and outright lies  in an effort to elect Hillary Clinton President "" the lawsuit charges.
CLOSE Summer Zervos accused  Donald Trump  of groping her  and she filed a defamation lawsuit after  he  called her accusations a lie. Video provided by Newsy Newslook
 Trump  has denied Zervos' allegations  which echo other womenâs claims.  Trump  has dismissed them as false.
During Tuesday's court hearing  Kasowitz contended that  Trump 's statements about Zervos were constitutionally protected remarks in which  he  defended  himself .

 Trump 's attorneys are relying on some of the legal arguments then-President Bill Clinton's lawyers made when he was accused in a 1994 federal court lawsuit over an alleged sexual assault. Paula Jones alleged that the attack took place in 1991 when she was an Arkansas state employee and Clinton was the state's governor.

5135,Exclusive â Darling: Obama Holdovers Compromise U.S. Nuclear Security,Obama,"Right now  Obama Administration holdovers and Never-Trump bureaucrats have undermined Trumpâs America First policies.
NNSA is trying to give up something weâve never had before: international inspections of key Russian nuclear facilities. And with only a single exception  each member of NNSAâs leadership team was put into his or her position by the Obama administration.
Thatâs gone  at least for now  because Russia âsuspendedâ its participation in the PMDA in October 2016 as a response to  Obamaâs  campaign to kill the U.S. MOX program. And just a couple of months ago  the Russians repeated their position as one taken in response to the same  Obama  people doing the same thing in the Trump administration.
The Deep State has really done it this time. Itâs managed in a single  Obama  policy to compromise American safety  while betraying the presidentâs electoral base. And itâs done it in defiance of congress  which throughout the  Obama  era  and continuing through today  has continued to fund and require MOX construction.
If thereâs a surprise here  itâs that Energy Secretary Rick Perry â a stalwart nuclear technology champion â has so passively accepted whatever the  Obama  people have handed him  seemingly with no questions asked.
The NNSA is surely a swamp to be drained while its  Obama -era policy is reversed.

5136,Trump Follows Reagan's Populist,Trump,"What brings the moment back is Laura Ingraham's new book: ""Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to  Trump ."" Thesis:  Donald Trump  is a conservative populist and direct descendant and rightful heir to Ronald Reagan.
To never-Trumpers this is pure blasphemy. Yet the similarities are there.
 Trump  is out of Queens  a builder-businessman in a Democratic city whose Republican credentials were suspect at best when  he  rode down that elevator at Trump Tower. Both took on the Republican establishment of their day  and humiliated it.
Among the signature issues of Trumpian populism is economic nationalism  a new trade policy designed to prosper Americans first.
 Reagan and Trump both  embraced the Eisenhower doctrine of ""peace through strength."" And  like Ike   both  built up the military.
 Both  also believed in cutting tax rates to stimulate the economy and balance the federal budget through rising revenues rather than cutting programs like Medicare and Social Security.
 Both  believed in engaging with the superpower rival of the day â the Soviet Union in Reagan's day  Russia and China in  Trump 's time.
And  both  were regarded in this capital city with a cosmopolitan condescension bordering on contempt. ""An amiable dunce"" said a Great Society Democrat of Reagan.
The awesome victories Reagan rolled up  a 44-state landslide in 1980 and a 49-state landslide in 1984  induced some second thoughts among Beltway elites about whether they truly spoke for America.  Trump 's sweep of the primaries and startling triumph in the Electoral College caused the same consternation.
As Ingraham writes  Trumpism is rooted as much in the populist-nationalist campaigns of the 1990s  and post-Cold War issues as economic patriotism  border security  immigration control and ""America First "" as it is in the Reaganite issues of the 1980s.
The differences between  Trump  in  his  first year and Reagan in 1981 are stark. Reagan had won a landslide. The attempt on his life in April and the grace with which he conducted himself had earned him a place in the hearts of his countrymen. He not only showed spine in giving the air traffic controllers 48 hours to get back to work  and then discharging them when they defied him  he enacted the largest tax cut in U.S. history with the aid of boll weevil Democrats in the House.
Coming up on one year since his election   Trump  is besieged by a hostile press and united Democratic Party.  This city  hates  him . While  his  executive actions are impressive   his  legislative accomplishments are not.  His  approval ratings have lingered in the mid-30s.  He  has lost half a dozen senior members of  his  original White House staff  clashed openly with  his  own Cabinet and is at war with GOP leaders on the Hill.
Moreover  we seem close to war with North Korea that would be no cakewalk. And  the president  appears determined to tear up the Obama nuclear deal with Iran that  his  own national security team believes is in the national interest.
Reagan was  as  Trump  claimed to be  an anti-interventionist. Reagan had no wish to be a war president. His dream was to rid the world of nuclear weapons. This does not sound like  Trump  in October 2017.
Steve Bannon may see the 25th Amendment  where a Cabinet majority may depose a president  as the great threat to  Trump .
But it is far more likely that a major war would do for the  Trump  presidency and  his  place in history what it did for Presidents Wilson  Truman  LBJ and George W.

""No other country has established its embassy in Jerusalem  which is sacred to Jews  Muslims and Christians. Its final status has been a central point of contention in peace talks for decades.""

5138,Trump calls for money for border wall by 2028 a week too late,Donald Trump,"The White House unveiled a budget proposal on Monday heavy on fulfilling President Donald Trump's campaign promises  pressing for new spending on infrastructure and a border wall. But the document â always a political exercise by Presidents that stands little chance of being adopted by Congress â is especially immaterial this year  since lawmakers approved a two-year spending plan just last week.
Ooops! Maybe last week was the time to demand money for a border wall! Maybe last week  when the government had a must-pass bill to keep the government open  was the time when  Trump  had the most leverage to demand funding for  his  wall. Democrats  who had briefly shut down the government to demand amnesty for illegals  saw that tactic backfire on them and were afraid to do so again. Imagine if  Trump  had noticed their reticence and used the opportunity to demand border wall funding!
Unfortunately  this happens only in MAGA fan fiction. Now that the Congress is getting down to the business of individual spending bills  Democrats have no incentive to give  Trump  anything. They can get the departments they like funded while stiffing the Department of Homeland Security.
But it still isn't clear if  Trump  even wants a border wall   he 's so far to the left on immigration in general. Listen to Mark Levin (at the 28-minute mark) talking about the president's negotiating position on immigration. Democrats had asked for legalization of 700 000 illegals  and the president responded by offering citizenship for 1.8 million.
Here's another tidbit:  Trump  is requesting funds to build a border wall...over ten years.
About $1.6 billion in  Trump 's budget would add 65 miles of walls along the southern border with Mexico. That's part of  Trump 's request of $18 billion over 10 years to build additional walls and fences along the border.","The White House unveiled a budget proposal on Monday heavy on fulfilling President  [TGT] 's campaign promises  pressing for new spending on infrastructure and a border wall.

5139,Trump makes waves as he eyes Jerusalem as Israelâs capital,Trump,"In a move that could undo decades of American diplomacy   President Trump  on Tuesday told Arab and Israeli leaders  he  will recognize Jerusalem as Israelâs capital â despite opposition from many sides.
A formal announcement is expected to come Wednesday  but  Trump  laid the groundwork on phone calls Tuesday to leaders of the Palestinian Authority and Jordan.
 Trump  told the president of the Palestinian Authority  Mahmoud Abbas  that the U.S. will move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Jordan said the president gave a similar message to King Abdullah II  according to The New York Times.

 Trump  is expected to sign a waiver allowing the embassy to stay in Tel Aviv for six months while logistics of the move are worked out.
U.S. officials familiar with  Trumpâs  thinking said on Wednesday  he  will declare Jerusalem as Israelâs capital  a symbolic move that could set off potentially violent protests.
 Trumpâs  decision â which analysts say has the potential to destabilize the region â comes as  his  son-in-law Jared Kushner has led an effort to revive Mideast peace talks.
The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday.
On the campaign trail   Trump  had repeatedly promised to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.

5140,Democrats must be ready to take this drastic step against Trump,Trump,"Today  various groups in the Senate will move toward putting forth proposals that would legalize as many as 1.8 million dreamers in exchange for concessions. Axios reports that a âsenior administration officialâ says  President Trump  will veto anything that does not advance all of  his  demands: a wall on the border and an end to the diversity visa lottery system and family-based migration  which would mean deep cuts to legal immigration.
 That senior official  claimed that this constitutes âthe mainstream  middle ground on immigration.â GOP senators are making similar claims. John Cornyn (Tex.) says  the president  shouldnât budge  because  his  proposal is âenormously generous â while Democrats are being âheartlessâ toward the dreamers by failing to accept it. Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.) insists that  Trumpâs  proposal is a âsweet bipartisan deal â and that if Dems reject it  Republicans are âlooking pretty good from a PR standpoint.â
 Trump  is the one who ended protections for the dreamers to begin with.  Trump  then said  he  wanted Congress to come up with a bipartisan solution protecting them in a more permanent way.  Trump  has repeatedly said protecting the dreamers is the right thing to do. Whether  he  means this or not is beside the point; perhaps entirely because  he  doesnât want to be blamed for driving them underground   he  wants to be associated with an outcome in which they are protected. Dem and GOP senators produced a version of the deal  Trump  asked for  one in which the dreamers would be legalized in exchange for cutting diversity visas and nixing any possibility of legalization for the dreamersâ parents. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer even expressed openness to giving  Trump  money for  his  wall.  Trump  rejected those offers. Dems repeatedly asked administration officials what further concessions they might accept and got no answer. Now officials are threatening a veto if  Trump  doesnât get everything  he  wants  and Republicans are describing this as the middle-ground position.
It is true that Democrats wonât give  Trump  everything  he  wants. As Dylan Scott and Tara Golshan lay out  numerous proposals legalizing the dreamers will likely be voted on this week. One is close to what  Trump  wants and would cut legal immigration by huge amounts. Another wouldnât cut legal immigration but would give  Trump  the border security money  he  wants. Still another would shift some visas toward the skills-based system  he  wants but probably without cutting overall legal immigration flows. Many people following the debate also expect a proposal to emerge that gives  Trump  money for the wall in exchange for protecting the dreamers. Yes  Democrats will vote against plans that deeply cut legal immigration. But they will likely support bills that make at least some of these other concessions  and perhaps more. (Time will tell.)
By contrast   Trump  and most Republicans will very likely oppose the bills that give both sides some of what they want and continue to insist on basically giving  Trump  all of what he wants. This is not a balanced situation  particularly since  Trump  wants to be associated with protecting the dreamers anyway. It is true that many congressional Republicans donât actually want to protect the dreamers and view doing this as a concession. But they are nonetheless going along with  Trump  in demanding far more in concessions than Democrats are. The Republicansâ position is that they wonât protect the dreamers unless Democrats give  Trump  all the border-security money and deep cuts to legal immigration he wants â while calling that a compromise.
If  Trump  and Republicans are going to stick to this position  Democrats really have no choice but to say no. This way of doing business must be flatly repudiated. If  Trump  and Republicans donât want to protect the dreamers  then so be it. And by the way  if Dems do walk away  they will have the support of many of the dreamers themselves.
âIf theyâre going to demand the Stephen Miller wish list  Democrats should say no â Greisa Martinez Rosas  the director of advocacy and policy for United We Dream  told me this morning. âThereâs a line for how much we will allow  Trump  and Miller to extract for our protection.â
It had been held by a Republican in Sarasota County  where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by 12 000  or about 10 percentage points.  â¦ Trump  had carried the district by 4.6 percentage points in a state that  he  won by just 1.2 points â¦ Goodâs win was the 36th Republican legislative seat in the nation that a Democrat has won since 2016.
Amid all the chatter about the tightening generic ballot and  Trumpâs  slightly rising approval  we keep getting good signs like this one.
* REPUBLICANS FRET ABOUT DEM WINS: Dave Weigel puts the big Florida upset in context  pointing out that even Republicans will be worried about what it portends. Here âs Trump âs former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski:
âTheyâre winning elections in places where they shouldnât be. Weâve seen them win statehouse seats in Wisconsin. Weâve seen them win big mayor âs  races in New Hampshire. Fifty seats have already changed hands  from Republicans to Democrats  since  President Trump  took office. Make no mistake: The Democrats are unified.â
And  Trump  is very likely to keep on giving.
*  TRUMP  WORRIES ABOUT HOW PORTER MESS AFFECTS HIM: The Post reports this remarkable tidbit:
 The president  has said little publicly about the Porter issue other than to praise the former aide for doing âa very good job.â But  he  has privately expressed frustration with the week-long fallout  peppering advisers and confidants with questions about the media coverage and how the controversy is playing for  him  personally.

 Trump  gave a speech touting the recently passed tax reform bill and the economy at the H&K Equipment Company in Coraopolis  Pennsylvania  located in the stateâs vacant 18th congressional district  which was held by Republican Tim Murphy until he was forced to resign after an embarrassing scandal.
Speaking to reporters prior to his speech   Trump  had kind words for State Representative Rick Saccone  a former military intelligence officer  who is taking on Democrat Conor Lamb  a former federal prosecutor and Marine Corps veteran.
""Rick is a great guy  "" Trump  said  adding that he plans to return to the district before the March 13 special election to campaign for Saccone.
""I'll be back for Rick  and we're going to fill up a stadium and we're going to do something really special for Rick. I look forward to it ""  Trump  said.
âI am going to spend probably four or five days a week helping people because we need more Republicans â  President Trump  told Reuters in an interview Wednesday  âI will be very much involved with - beyond the primaries - with the election itself  very very much.â
Lamb faces an uphill battle in Pennsylvaniaâs 18th district  which is tucked in the stateâs southwestern corner. The district voted for  President Trump  by nearly 20 points in the 2016 presidential election  and had been represented by Murphy since 2003.
The Democratâs campaign released its first television advertisement Thursday  which highlights Lambâs military and legal experience  and also re-iterates  his  call for new congressional leadership in both parties.
 The president âs visit comes as Republican anxiety about the 2018 midterms is only increasing  as Democrats are looking to seize on the momentum from recent victories in redder parts of the country like Alabama  where last month a Democrat was elected to the U.S. Senate for the first time in over two decades.","In a sign that he is eager to involve himself in the coming 2018 midterm elections    [TGT] spoke today in southwestern Pennsylvania in the midst of a special election that could test his support in the same working class areas that propelled him to the presidency.

5143,Trump Wins First Round in Legal Battle Over Emoluments,Donald Trump,"To a certain segment of the American population â those who have spent the past 336 days (but who's counting?) dreaming of the end of the Donald Trump presidency â the two words that have given them the most hope have been ""Mueller"" and ""emoluments."" Almost everyone knows that the Robert Mueller investigation is moving forward amid serious questions whether  Donald Trump  will fire  him   so let's talk about what's happening with the emoluments issue.
Days after  Trump  became president  the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  a good government watchdog group  brought a lawsuit against the president claiming that his continuing to own his hotel chains around the world was an illegal emolument. Yesterday  crushing the hopes of those looking to topple  Trump   a federal judge threw this lawsuit out of court.
What's this have to do with  Donald Trump ? Well  unless you've completely ignored everything about our president  you know that he has hotels all over the world. The theory of the lawsuit against him is that  now that he's President of the United States  foreign leaders will stay in those hotels over competitors as a way to curry favor with the president. Think about it this way: If you're the head of state of another country that needs to win  President Trump  over for your country's benefit and you need a hotel room for the night when you're traveling  would you choose a  Trump  hotel or one of  his  nearby competitors? CREW and a few competitor hotel owners claim in their lawsuit that the foreign dignitaries will choose the  Trump  hotel  thus both enriching the President and winning  him  over as a result. To the plaintiffs   Trump 's continued ownership of these hotels while President is a violation of the Emoluments Clause and is a signal that he is being bought by foreign leaders.
In response to the lawsuit  the  Trump  administration made several claims. Their most substantive response was that paying a hotel bill is not a ""present"" or ""emolument"" but rather an ordinary business transaction. To  Trump   a foreign leader engaging in such a small-time deal with a Trump business has nothing to do with American foreign policy and is not ripe for the corruption the Constitution prohibits.","To a certain segment of the American population â those who have spent the past 336 days (but who's counting?) dreaming of the end of the Donald Trump presidency â the two words that have given them the most hope have been ""Mueller"" and ""emoluments."" Almost everyone knows that the Robert Mueller investigation is moving forward amid serious questions whether   [TGT] will fire   [TGT]    so let's talk about what's happening with the emoluments issue.
Days after   [TGT] became president  the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW)  a good government watchdog group  brought a lawsuit against the president claiming that his continuing to own his hotel chains around the world was an illegal emolument. Yesterday  crushing the hopes of those looking to topple  Trump   a federal judge threw this lawsuit out of court.
What's this have to do with  [TGT]  ? Well  unless you've completely ignored everything about our president  you know that he has hotels all over the world. The theory of the lawsuit against him is that  now that he's President of the United States  foreign leaders will stay in those hotels over competitors as a way to curry favor with the president. Think about it this way: If you're the head of state of another country that needs to win   [TGT] over for your country's benefit and you need a hotel room for the night when you're traveling  would you choose a   [TGT] hotel or one of   [TGT]   nearby competitors? CREW and a few competitor hotel owners claim in their lawsuit that the foreign dignitaries will choose the   [TGT] hotel  thus both enriching the President and winning  him  over as a result. To the plaintiffs   Trump 's continued ownership of these hotels while President is a violation of the Emoluments Clause and is a signal that he is being bought by foreign leaders.
In response to the lawsuit  the   [TGT]   administration made several claims. Their most substantive response was that paying a hotel bill is not a ""present"" or ""emolument"" but rather an ordinary business transaction. To  Trump   a foreign leader engaging in such a small-time deal with a  [TGT]  business has nothing to do with American foreign policy and is not ripe for the corruption the Constitution prohibits.",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,,
5144,NYT: Rachel Brand No. 3 Justice Dept. Official Stepping Down,Donald Trump,"The U.S. Justice Department's third-ranking official  Rachel Brand  plans to step down after just nine months on the job  the New York Times reported on Friday  at a time when  President Donald Trump  has taken aim at senior law enforcement officials.
Brand was next in line of succession to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into potential collusion between  Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and whether  the Republican president  has unlawfully sought to obstruct the ongoing probe.
Brand's resignation is the latest sign of turmoil at U.S. law enforcement agencies  which have come under sustained attack by  Trump  and  his  Republican allies in recent months. The Times reported that Brand will resign  citing two people briefed on her decision.
News of her departure comes a week after  Trump  approved the release of a previously classified memo written by Republican lawmakers that portrayed the Russia investigation  initially handled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and now headed by Mueller  as a product of political bias against  Trump  at the Justice Department and FBI.
 Trump  also has criticized Sessions for recusing  himself .
On Feb. 2  just hours before  Trump  approved the release of the Republican memo  Sessions offered praise for Rosenstein  the department's No. 2 official  and Brand  saying they ""represent the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.""","The U.S. Justice Department's third-ranking official  Rachel Brand  plans to step down after just nine months on the job  the New York Times reported on Friday  at a time when   [TGT] has taken aim at senior law enforcement officials.

5145,Doubt in Las Vegas that DC can solve gun violence,Donald Trump,"Ahead of  President Donald Trump 's visit Wednesday to a stunned Las Vegas  a kind of eerie stillness settled over this usually throbbing and vibrant city. In interviews with nearly two dozen people around the Las Vegas Strip and in the suburbs  the sense of frustration and hopelessness was palpable  accompanied by political apathy and disdain for the debate in Washington  where Republicans are largely resisting Democratic calls to review and toughen gun laws.
After a crime with no discernible motive  few people here had answers about what  Trump  or members of Congress could do to prevent the next tragedy. The blood banks  having met their need for the time being  were turning people away. At times  there seemed to be more volunteers passing mini muffins and orange juice than people to take them.
For more than two decades  Nevada has been a critical swing state  helping deliver the White House twice for George W. Bush  and then twice for Barack Obama. The open congressional seat in the third district  south of Las Vegas  could help determine whether Republicans maintain control of the House of Representatives next year. And voters here could also determine control of the Senate when they decide on the fate of GOP Sen. Dean Heller  who was targeted by  Trump  during the health care debate.
The state's governor  Brian Sandoval  is an enigmatic Republican with strong crossover appeal who was able to tap into the rapidly growing Latino population to win re-election. Latino voters  along with the powerful organizing forces of labor in Clark County  helped Hillary Clinton notch her narrow victory over  Trump  here last fall.
Holden  who voted for  Trump   said she wasn't sure what he could do other than offer ""a lot of reassurance that this isn't going to happen again.""
 Trump  will arrive Wednesday in a city that is still struggling for normalcy. Large portions of Las Vegas Boulevard were closed to traffic until late Tuesday. The enormous LED screens that tower above the highway from the airport to the strip  which normally advertise shows and other attractions  flashed simple black and white messages thanking first responders and directing drivers to visit the Red Cross website.
While  Trump  has received sharp criticism in Washington for  his  handling of recent disasters and tragedies -- from  his  slow reaction to violence in Charlottesville  Virginia  to  his  taunting of the San Juan mayor after the devastation of the recent hurricane in Puerto Rico -- a number of people here welcomed  his  visit.","Ahead of  President  [TGT]  's visit Wednesday to a stunned Las Vegas  a kind of eerie stillness settled over this usually throbbing and vibrant city.

5148,Was Trumpâs Endorsement Of Roy Moore A Mistake?,Trump,"micah (Micah Cohen  politics editor): Welcome  all! Our topic for today: President Trumpâs endorsement of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. (And the Republican National Committee decision to support him again.) My question is â¦ what gives? Is this a political mistake?
harry (Harry Enten  senior political writer): I think itâs a stupid move.  Trump  is clearly trying to score a âwin â but itâs far from certain that Moore will get him one. All thatâs happened in that case is that heâs endorsed an accused child molester.
natesilver (Nate Silver  editor in chief):  Trump  coming out to endorse Moore is extremely â¦ unsurprising. And  yeah  I donât think it will change very much.
harry: I guess my question is: What is it that made  Trump  go from mostly endorsing Moore â essentially by attacking his opponent  Democrat Doug Jones â to fully endorsing him. Why do that?
natesilver: Have you ever known  Donald Trump  to take a half-measure? Everything plays out into the most extreme possible version of itself.
micah:  He  may have half-colluded?
harry:  He  ordered the code red!
julia_azari: So the âI hate political correctnessâ narrative seems to have worked out well for  Trump  in general. I wonder if  he  thinks this can be filed under that somehow â i.e.  liberals are going after someone for accusations that either didnât happen  or were a long time ago  or werenât as bad as they sound (to gather up a range of talking points made in Mooreâs defense).
Supporting Moore fits snuggly into  Trump âs larger message and image.
If Moore wins  I wonder if  Trump  would instinctually come out against expelling  him  because  he 'd see it as foreshadowing an impeachment proceeding. â Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) November 15  2017
And  Trump  might see  himself  as being unfairly attacked by the liberal media  just as Moore has been.
micah: OK  so Nate and I had an argument about this the other day  but how about this theory:  Trump  moved to a full-throated Moore endorsement because  he  has internal polling that shows Mooreâs lead increasing and so wants to hop on the bandwagon.
harry:  Trump  is likely looking at public polling. So  it âs simple  and I like  it .
natesilver: The simplest answer is that  Trump  supports Moore because birds of a feather flock together. And then the RNC backtracked so as to stay on the same page as  Trump . Also  the GOP brand was already going to take the PR hit once  Trump  endorsed Moore  so why not drop a few bucks on him?
harry: If theyâre so similar  then why in the heck did  Trump  not endorse  him  in the primary? Honest question.

5149,The economy is not Trump's ticket to 2020 victory (opinion),Donald Trump,"(CNN)  Donald Trump  became the first US president to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos and bragged  like  he  often has  about the state of the American economy. It won't save  his  presidency.
Something that  Trump  fans  and even #NeverTrumpers (like New York Times columnist Bret Stephens ) don't seem to understand: it's no longer just ""the economy  stupid."" Why? Because  Donald Trump  and  his  most ardent supporters spent the Obama era setting a new precedent: that good economic news is to be ignored  downplayed or disbelieved -- or at least never credited to the guy in the White House.
 They  did this during the presidency of the first black man to hold that office -- a man who had helped to steer the US economy from the brink of collapse into the longest monthly job creation streak in the country's history.
That  Trump  supporters then turned around and were able to elect a man who rose to national political prominence while using open bigotry shows that the new standard was now in place: voters will give as much credit for a good economy in November  2018  or in 2020 as  Trump  fans gave President Obama.
While  Trump  has talked up economic performance during  his  first year  it was simply a repeat of what we saw during the final Obama years: solid quarters of growth bracketed by slower growth; monthly job increases and historically low jobless claims; and high levels of inequality. In 2017  the economy grew 2.3% -- in line with its performance under Obama. But under Obama  the poor and middle class had their biggest annual wage increase ever  and more Americans had health insurance than ever.
 Trump  has conditioned us to disbelieve economic indicators  as did some of  his  high-profile supporters  who claimed the jobless rate was dropping under Obama because the books had been cooked. They did not care that the S&P 500 nearly tripled during the Obama years  even as they now tout every new record high under  Trump . They did not care that the unemployment rate dropped from 10% early in Obama's tenure to less than 5% by the time he left office. Neither did they care that the poor and middle class received the largest annual increase in wages on record in 2016
They credit  Trump 's deregulation talk and tax cuts  neither of which have fully kicked in  for recent economic growth  but ignored the millions of jobs created by the Obama stimulus or two even larger tax cuts under the previous President.
They don't even care that  Trump  broke multiple promises to those in  his  base  including those Carrier jobs  he  supposedly saved in Indiana that weren't saved.  His  administration is current dismantling a consumer protection bureau that helped level the playing field between corporations and the poor and middle class. While various corporations have announced bonuses and modest raises because of the tax cut that is now trickling its way through the economy  they have still been announcing massive layoffs.","(CNN)   [TGT] became the first US president to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos and bragged  like   [TGT]   often has  about the state of the American economy.

5153,Years Of U.S. Government Lies Could Soon Result In A Kurdish Massacre,Donald Trump,"American officials designed that fiction to enable the anti-ISIS strategy adopted under President Barack Obama and continued under  President Donald Trump . Now itâs taking its most serious toll yet: Turkey is bombarding Afrin  a Kurdish enclave in northwest Syria  with airstrikes and artillery fire and the U.S. is refusing responsibility. Extending the Obama-era logic  team  Trump  maintains that Afrin is totally distinct from the Kurdish regions in Syriaâs northeast that are home to American bases and thousands of U.S. troops.
Dozens of civilians have died in the campaignâs initial assault on smaller villages around the main city. Over a million more are at risk  as are Turkish civilians facing rockets in response. And  Trump âs choice has boosted bitterness toward the U.S. among Washingtonâs most effective partners in Syria. In the weeks ahead  it could torpedo U.S.-brokered cooperation between Kurds and the countryâs majority Arab community  tempting more Arabs to join radical groups like the powerful local al Qaeda affiliate or whatâs left of ISIS; escalate an already dire humanitarian crisis; and cede more space in Syria to actors  Trump  is ostensibly committed to challenging â Russia  Iran and the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Thereâs little clear benefit to the U.S. in return.
Its most serious move so far was an apparently harsh call between Erdogan and  Trump  on Jan. 24. The readout said  Trump  repeatedly praised the U.S.-Turkey partnership but warned that Erdogan was proceeding down a path that could result in âconflict between Turkish and American forces.â
âMy general sense on Afrin is that it shows the dysfunction of  Trump âs national security process â Colin Kahl  one of the top Obama-era officials managing the relationship with Turkey  wrote in an email this week to HuffPost.
He pointed out that the administration set the stage for the clash by  Trump  first telling Erdogan  in November  that the U.S. would cut off heavy weapons to the YPG  and officials then talking about an extended U.S. presence alongside the YPG-dominated forces less than two months later.","American officials designed that fiction to enable the anti-ISIS strategy adopted under President Barack Obama and continued under  [TGT]  .

5155,Trump tax plan: How your take,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump's tax plan  is being billed by the White House and Republicans as a boon for the middle class.
Exactly how much individuals save will depend on many factors  and as Business Insider's Josh Barro pointed out  tax cuts for average Americans aren't likely to be as sweeping as Republicans make it sound. Some analysts think  the current plan  will have to be scaled back considerably  since  it  would reduce federal government revenue by an estimated (and unsustainable) $5.8 trillion over 10 years.
Still  as it stands now  take-home pay could increase for most Americans under  Trump 's tax plan.
We were curious how it might change  so we ran some numbers using the current proposal  and filling in the gaps with details from  Trump 's candidate tax plan.
 Trump 's tax plan proposes three federal income tax brackets: 12%  25%  and 35%  but it does not yet specify income ranges for the proposed tax brackets. We calculated the above estimates using single filer income ranges from  Trump 's candidate tax plan for each of the tax brackets proposed in  the current plan : 12%: $0-$50 000; 25%: $50 001-$150 000; 35%: $150 001 or more
 Trump 's candidate tax plan â which has many similarities to the current tax plan  including keeping the mortgage interest and charitable giving deductions and repealing the AMT â proposed a 0% tax on earnings up to $25 000 (to eliminate ""redundant"" deductions)  as well as the following tax brackets and income ranges for single taxpayers:
The estimates above show how much single  childless taxpayers at different income levels might save if tax reform passes â something that could prove challenging  given the trouble  Trump  has faced in  his  attempts to overhaul the US healthcare system.
Americans who do claim the standard deduction will be able to reduce their taxable income further under  Trump 's tax plan  in turn reducing their tax bill. Single filers would deduct $12 000  slightly higher than the current combined $10 400 deduction  which includes the standard deduction and one personal exemption. Joint filers would deduct $24 000  up from the current $20 800  which includes the standard deduction and two personal exemptions.
But   Trump 's tax plan would do away with many deductions  which could increase federal taxes for Americans who itemize their deductions. Among those who do  the average claimed for 2014 was $27 447.
 Trump  and  his  tax team â which includes House Speaker Paul Ryan  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady â have said they want to make ""the tax code simple  fair and easy to understand.""","[TGT] 's tax plan  is being billed by the White House and Republicans as a boon for the middle class.

5156,Rep. Darrell Issa To Retire Adding To Record GOP Exodus From Congress : NPR,Donald Trump,"On Monday  Royce  a California Republican  added his name to the retirement roster. The House Foreign Affairs chairman is now one of eight committee chairmen who are calling it quits. And now with Issa also leaving  there are four open districts held by a GOP member that  Trump  lost last election  making those top Democratic opportunities.
Democrats need 24 seats to flip control of the House  and history  in addition to other promising signs  is on their side. Going back to World War II  the president's party loses an average of 28 seats in his first midterm election â and none of those happened with a president's approval rating as low as  Trump 's currently sits. The exception was in 2002  when the Republicans gained seats about a year after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Royce and Issa could both fall into that category. Royce had insisted last year that he was on board for another term  but then abruptly changed his mind on Monday. His Orange County district â which used to be solid Republican territory â voted for  Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump  in 2016 by more than 8 points. It's now one of the most vulnerable seats in the country and follows a pattern of longtime GOP-held suburban seats sliding away from Republican control.
Issa's San Diego seat also shifted quite a bit after the last election.  Trump  lost this seat by 7 points  while in 2012  GOP nominee Mitt Romney carried it by 6 points. Issa also narrowly escaped with a victory in 2016  only winning by 1 621 votes.
Even before Issa's and Royce's announcements  there were already other retirements for Republicans in diverse  swing seats that  Clinton  won  inducing heartburn for party leaders. Rep. Illena Ros-Lehtinen's Miami district is all but gone for the GOP;  Trump  lost it by 19 points to  Clinton   making it the most Democratic-leaning seat held by a Republican.
Republicans could struggle to hold onto Washington Rep. Dave Reichert's suburban Seattle district  too.  Clinton  eked out a 3-point victory there  and it sits dead in the center of the Partisan Voter Index  a measure by the Cook Political Report of the competitiveness of districts.
And there is likely to be another opening on the board if Arizona GOP Rep. Martha McSally  as expected  announces her bid for Senate on Friday.  Clinton  carried  her  Tucson district by about 5 points in 2016.
There are other open seats created by retirements that give Democrats opportunities as well  particularly in marginal seats.  Trump  won the districts of both retiring Reps. Dave Trott  R-Mich.  and Charlie Dent  R-Pa.  by 7 points or less  and the Partisan Voter Index gives them both a rating of R+4. Democrats also have a shot at Rep. Frank LoBiondo's southern New Jersey district  which  Trump  carried by 4 points and is rated R+1.
The most problematic opening is created by Rep. Tim Walz's decision to run for  Minnesota governor â Trump  carried  his  district by 15 points. Another seat Democrats will have to fight to hold on to is that of Rep. Carol Shea-Porter  D-N.H.  who is retiring and is the only Democrat leaving outright who sits in a district  Trump  won.
Two Senate candidates that give Democrats excellent shots at picking up seats in Arizona and Nevada have  in turn  created headaches for the House committee. Trump carried Rep. Jacky Rosen's southern Nevada seat by 1 point  and she only barely beat a weak GOP candidate. In Arizona  Rep. Kyrsten Sinema's decision to run for Senate gives Republicans an opening as well â her seat has a PVI of only D+4; however   Clinton  easily won the district by 16 points.
And the decision by Rep. Ruben Kihuen  D-Nev.  not to seek re-election amid sexual harassment allegations adds another seat Democrats have to defend in a district  Clinton  only carried by 5 points.
The member pointed to the fact that upwards of 80 percent of Republicans remain supportive of  Trump   higher than GOP support for President George W. Bush ahead of the 2006 midterm elections when Democrats swept to power.

5158,Trump declares war on the Constitution,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump  is to conservatism as SpaghettiOs are to Italian food: a distant  crude and almost unrecognizable cousin. But last year  many conservatives who had trouble rationalizing a vote for  Donald Trump  settled on one decisive reason. Justices appointed by President Hillary Clinton  they said  could not be trusted to faithfully follow the Constitution.
These strict constructionists now find themselves with a president who regards the nationâs founding document as something between an irrelevance and a wad of gum stuck to his shoe. On Wednesday  he uttered statements that would have shocked conservatives had they come from Clinton or Barack Obama but were taken as inconsequential coming from  Trump .
 Trump  has held up the late Antonin Scalia as  his  model of a justice.  Scalia  disdained the idea of a âliving Constitutionâ whose meaning evolves over time. âThe only good Constitution is a dead Constitution â  he  declared.
If  Trump  had  his  way  the Constitution would be deader than the czars  though not quite in the way  Scalia  meant. When the president swore an oath to âpreserve  protect and defend the Constitution of the United States â he took it just as seriously as the debts he escaped in bankruptcy court.
 Trump  would start by amputating the First Amendment  which upholds the disgusting freedom of journalists to âwrite whatever they want to write.â This is the same president who invited violence against reporters by tweeting a video doctored to make it look like he was punching a CNN representative.
But  Trumpâs  empty threat flowed naturally from  his  past pronouncements on such matters. During the campaign   he  vowed to change libel laws to make it easier for the likes of  him  â loudmouthed  grossly dishonest public figures â to win libel suits.
 His  position is at war with one of the Supreme Courtâs most important and unassailable decisions  reached in 1964. It said the First Amendment requires that citizens be able to express their views without fear of being punished for inadvertent misstatements. If  Trump  were thinking clearly   he  would realize that existing libel law is  his  friend  because it immunizes  him  for  his  fraudulent claims about critics.
 His  three orders on foreigners traveling to the United States so obviously stemmed from  his  campaign vow to ban all Muslims that administration lawyers implored judges to forget everything  he  had previously said. The judges didnât. The first two travel orders were ruled unconstitutional  and the latest is being challenged.
 He  and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have spurned the January Justice Department report that found Chicago police guilty of âpattern or practice of unconstitutional use of forceâ â including killing people without a good reason. Barack Obamaâs Justice Department wanted to prevent these abuses through a consent decree. Sessions has no interest in fixing or even noticing such problems.
 He  flaunted  his  indifference in a memo rejecting corrective action: âIt is not the responsibility of the federal government to manage non-federal law enforcement agencies.â Actually  when they violate the federal Constitution  it is.","[TGT] is to conservatism as SpaghettiOs are to Italian food: a distant  crude and almost unrecognizable cousin.

5159,The Latest: Trump says Podesta resignation biggest story,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â The Latest on President Donald Trump and the Russia investigation (all times local):
 President Donald Trump  is tweeting that the ""biggest story"" out of the charges announced Monday in the Russia investigation is the resignation of Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta from his eponymous firm.
""The biggest story yesterday  the one that has the Dems in a dither  is Podesta running from his firm  "" Trump  wrote in a two-part tweet that contained grammatical errors. ""What  he  know about Crooked Dems is....earth shattering ""  he  tweeted.
 The president  added  "" He  and  his  brother could Drain The Swamp  which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!""
Court papers unsealed Monday revealed an indictment against  Trump 's former campaign chairman  Paul Manafort  and a guilty plea by another adviser  who admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says he sees nothing wrong with a former campaign adviser to  President Donald Trump  reaching out to a Kremlin-linked think tank.
Court papers unsealed on Monday revealed that George Papadopoulos who worked on the  Trump  campaign had reached out to a Russian he believed to have links to the Russian foreign ministry to arrange a meeting between the  Trump  team and Russian officials.
 President Donald Trump  says a campaign adviser who has admitted to lying to the FBI about meetings with Russian intermediaries was a ""low level volunteer"" who was ""proven to be a liar.""
 Trump  on Twitter Tuesday sought to distance  himself  from George Papadopoulos: ""Few people knew the young  low level volunteer named George  who has already proven to be a liar.""
Court papers unsealed Monday also revealed an indictment against  Trump 's former campaign chairman  Paul Manafort.
 Trump  said the allegations happened ""long before""  he  joined the campaign. But the indictment details allegations stretching from 2006 to 2017.

Sekulow's comments to ABC's ""Good Morning America"" come a day after a former  Trump  aide admitted lying to the FBI about meeting with Russian intermediaries and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded not guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges.

5162,Will Trump Pardon Cliven Bundy? â Mother Jones,Donald Trump,"And now that  President Donald Trump  has pardoned Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio  infamous for his extreme use of profiling to target undocumented immigrants  Bundyâs supporters see an opportunity for him as well. Bundy has been in jail since February 2016 and is set to stand trial on October 10 for his role in the ranch standoff  along with his sons Ryan and Ammon and four other defendants.
 Longtime Trump  confidant Roger Stone has been leading the charge for a pardon  as he did for Arpaio. In July  Stone was the featured attraction at a Las Vegas fundraiser for the Bundy defendants. He gave a speech calling on  Trump  to âreview this case in the name of justice  in the name of mercyâ and âpardon every member of the Bundy family.â Following the roadmap he used for Arpaio  heâs also raised the issue on the conspiracy-theory website InfoWars  and he repeated the pardon calls last month in another visit to Las Vegas.
Itâs unclear how receptive  Trump  might be to the idea of a Bundy pardon.  Trump  was lukewarm on Bundy in 2014  when the ranch standoff was in the news.  He  told Fox Newsâ Sean Hannity at the time  âI like him  I like his spirit  his spunk and the people that are so loyalâ¦I respect him.â But he expressed uneasiness with Bundyâs taking the law into his own hands and suggested that he âcut a dealâ with the Obama administration to settle the cattle debate.
Now that  Trump  is president  he may have other ideas. Like his pardon of Arpaio  pardoning Bundy might play well with his base  particularly the white nationalists who arenât bothered byâor even admireâBundyâs 2014 comments that âthe Negroâ might have been better off under slavery. Most of the mainstream politicians whoâd initially supported Bundyâs cause quickly dropped him after video of his diatribe surfaced. Even Hannity dropped Bundyâs cause.
âI like him  I like his spirit  his spunk and the people that are so loyal â  Trump  said of Bundy.
But since becoming a presidential candidate and then president   Trump  has been sympathetic to the Bundy faction  which backed  him  in the election.  He  chose a Bundy ranch conspirator  Gerald DeLemus  as a New Hampshire convention delegate and state co-chair of Veterans for  Trump . DeLemus was unable to cast his vote for  Trump  at the Republican nominating convention because he was in jail on weapons and other charges from his role at the ranch standoff. Federal prosecutors described DeLemus as a âgunman and midlevel organizerâ whoâd overseen âCamp Liberty â which housed armed militia members near the Bundy ranch for several weeks after the BLMâs attempt to round up Bundyâs cattle. DeLemus pleaded guilty to the charges and was later sentenced to seven years in prison.
 Trump  also picked a Bundy sympathizer to serve on his transition team for the Interior Department  which oversees the BLM. In the 1990s  Karen Budd-Falen  a Wyoming property rights lawyer and former Reagan-era Interior Department official  represented ranchers in Bunkersville  where Bundy lives  who sued the BLM for trying to get their cows off the habitat of an endangered desert tortoise.
In 2014  Budd-Falen told the Daily Caller that âthe Cliven Bundy situation goes to show how American citizens react when a government has so expanded that it believes that the citizens are subservient to political power.â She went on  âThis is simply a case of the government putting a rancher out of business because the rancher has to prove a negativeâthe burden is on the rancher while all deference goes to the federal government and the government only has to make allegations to eliminate a family  a business  a community  a way of life.â Over the summer  rumors surfaced that  Trump  intended to nominate Budd-Falen to head the BLM. Budd-Falen did not respond to a request for comment.
In one of his last official acts in office  President Barack Obama turned 300 000 acres around the Bundy ranch into the Gold Butte National Monument  a federally protected area managed by the BLM. After  Trump  took office  one of the federal monuments Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recommended shrinking was Gold Butte.
Despite the  Trump  administrationâs sympathy for Bundy  a pardon might be premature. Bundy hasnât yet been convicted of a crime  and itâs not clear that he ever will be. The government has so far failed to convince a jury to convict anyone from the Bundy family on any criminal charges  either in Nevada or in Oregon  where Bundyâs son Ammon led the armed occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016.","And now that   [TGT] has pardoned Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio  infamous for  [TGT]  extreme use of profiling to target undocumented immigrants  Bundyâs supporters see an opportunity for  [TGT]  as well.

5165,"Publisher: Trump effort to suppress book ""flagrantly unconstitutional""",Trump,"WASHINGTON - The publisher of a book that questions  President Trump 's fitness for office said any effort by  Mr. Trump  to suppress the book would be ""flagrantly unconstitutional.""
In a letter to company employees Monday and shared with CBS News  Macmillan CEO John Sargent wrote ""no American court"" would go along with  President Trump  should  he  sue to have ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House""  withdrawn.
"" The president  is free to call news ""fake"" and to blast the media "" Sargent wrote. ""But a demand to cease and desist publication - a clear effort by the President of the United States to intimidate a publisher into halting publication of an important book on the workings of the government - is an attempt to achieve what is called prior restraint.""
Macmillan is the parent organization of Henry Holt and Company  which released the book  by author Michael Wolff. A  Trump  lawyer last week sent a cease and desist letter to the publisher  demanding it be withheld. Holt responded by moving up the release date from Jan. 9 to last Friday.
In the letter released to employees Monday  Sargent said that the company would send a formal response to  Trump  later in the day.
Wolff's book portrays  the 45th president  as a leader who doesn't understand the weight of  his  office and whose competence is questioned by aides.
Former  Trump Campaign  CEO and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was widely quoted. In one instance  he describes a meeting between Donald Trump Jr.  senior campaign aides and a Russian lawyer as ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic"". The reference angered the president  who last week said Bannon ""lost his mind.""
Over the weekend  the president's allies attacked the book in a round of television appearances Sunday. Chief policy adviser Stephen Miller  in a combative appearance Sunday on CNN  described the book as ""nothing but a pile of trash through and through.""

""I think he probably had no idea he was speaking to me for this book. When I would meet  the president  in the White House  we would chat as though we were friends "" Wolff said. ""I have sat down with the president for extended periods of interviews. But there are other periods -- and that's essentially what he's saying. They're trying to parse this  saying  'Oh  I didn't know I was speaking to him when I saw him in the White House.'""","WASHINGTON - The publisher of  [TGT] Mr. Trump  to suppress  [TGT]  would be ""flagrantly unconstitutional.""
In a letter to company employees Monday and shared with CBS News  Macmillan CEO John Sargent wrote ""no American court"" would go along with  [TGT] should   [TGT]   sue to have ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House""  withdrawn.
"" The president  is free to call news ""fake"" and to blast the media "" Sargent wrote. ""But a demand to cease and desist publication - a clear effort by the President of the United States to intimidate a publisher into halting publication of an important book on the workings of the government - is an attempt to achieve what is called prior restraint.""
Macmillan is the parent organization of Henry Holt and Company  which released the book  by author Michael Wolff. A   [TGT]   lawyer last week sent a cease and desist letter to the publisher  demanding it be withheld. Holt responded by moving up the release date from Jan. 9 to last Friday.
In the letter released to employees Monday  Sargent said that the company would send a formal response to  Trump  later in the day.
Wolff's book portrays  the 45th president  as a leader who doesn't understand the weight of  his  office and whose competence is questioned by aides.
Former  Trump Campaign  CEO and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was widely quoted. In one instance  he describes a meeting between Donald Trump Jr.  senior campaign aides and a Russian lawyer as ""treasonous"" and ""unpatriotic"". The reference angered the president  who last week said Bannon ""lost his mind.""
Over the weekend  the president's allies attacked the book in a round of television appearances Sunday. Chief policy adviser Stephen Miller  in a combative appearance Sunday on CNN  described the book as ""nothing but a pile of trash through and through."" While  the president  countered the book's claims by tweeting that  he  is a ""stable genius "" and said ""Fire and Fury"" is a ""fake book.""

5166,Pushback Against DeVos: Public Schools Are Our Best Future,Donald Trump,"An energized mix of teachers  Glen View neighborhood residents and an Oakland Unified School Board member  Roseann Torres  who co-sponsored a resolution last month making OUSD one of the stateâs first âsanctuaryâ districts  were holding protest signs praising public schools and rejecting Donald Trumpâs campaign pledge to deport millions  target Muslim-Americans and strip LGBT and reproductive rights.
Standing with students and their families was the priority on the eve of  Trump âs inauguration  Gorham said  not bashing DeVos  a billionaire who never attended public schools or sent her children to any  nor served on a locally elected school board  and whose family foundation has given multi-millions to K-12 privatization entrepreneurs.
Gregory Ewing  the new superintendent  beamed and responded  echoing what many of the walk-in protesters at Oaklandâs Edna Brewer Middle School were telling the students and communityâthat he would use all of his legal authority to protect students from the worst threats posed by the incoming  Trump â administration.
The fight over preserving  funding and improving Oaklandâs traditional K-12 schools was already very heated  Armendariz said  and that was before  Trump  campaigned on pledges to target undocumented immigrants  which strikes deep fears in this community.

5167,Donald Trump cancels London visit to open embassy in tweet blaming Barack Obama amid Britain protest calls,Donald Trump,"LONDON --  President Trump  has said  he  decided to cancel a working visit to London to officially open the new U.S. embassy because  he  doesn't like the building  and thinks  his  predecessor was wrong to ""sell"" the old one.
The so-called ""bad deal"" behind  Mr. Trump 's latest controversial tweet was for the construction of the gleaming new $1 billion embassy  which  reports CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti  is perched atop a man-made hill  behind a deep pond which officials insist is not a mote. It is billed as one of the most secure buildings in the world.
While the fortress-like compound in south London lives up to the extreme security posture  President Trump  has called for in the United States   he  said in  his  tweet that  he 's not a ""big fan "" and blamed President Obama for the move.
But  Mr. Trump  got  his  facts wrong. The ""bad deal"" was actually made by President George W. Bush in 2008  not President Obama.
 Mr. Trump 's cancellation comes amid calls for large protests outside the embassy's ribbon cutting event  and backlash over Prime Minister Teresa May's invitation to  Mr. Trump  for an official state visit  which was extended shortly after  his  inauguration.
Many Britons have been angered by what they see as  President Trump 's divisive politics  and  his  recent retweets of anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right white nationalist group Britain First.
Prime Minister May's office gave no direct response to  Mr. Trump 's cancellation of the working visit to open the embassy  dismissing it as a matter for the U.S. administration.
Many Londoners have made it clear that  Donald Trump  is not welcome here while  he  is pursuing such a divisive agenda. It seems  he âs finally got that message.

No one faulted  him  for canceling this trip to Washington  which  he  did Saturday.

5169,Trump threatens to take away more U.S. aid from Palestinians if they donât negotiate with Israel,Trump,"President Trump  met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  on  Jan. 25 where Netanyahu thanked Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as Israelâs capital .

 President Trump  met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  on  Jan. 25 where Netanyahu thanked Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as Israelâs capital . (The Washington Post)
 President Trump  threatened Thursday to write off the Palestinian leadership and withdraw further U.S. aid if Palestinians are not serious about negotiating peace with Israel  deepening a diplomatic rift and putting Trumpâs hopes for a historic agreement on hold.
 Trump  cast doubt on whether talks could happen now  and blamed Palestinian intransigence rather than his decision to shift decades of U.S. policy on the status of Jerusalem.
âThat money is on the table  and that money is not going to them unless they sit down and negotiate peace â  Trump  said of the hundreds of millions in U.S. aid for the Palestinians.
[Palestinian leader attacks  Trump   calling his peace deal the âslap of the centuryâ]
Sitting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines at the global economic forum here   Trump  said that  his  decision last month to recognize Jerusalem as Israelâs capital had removed a major obstacle to a deal. But   Trump  said  Israel would âpayâ for the concession in future negotiations.
Netanyahu shifted in his seat at that  but otherwise beamed as  Trump  said he âtook Jerusalem off the table â and described an accelerated timetable for moving âa small versionâ of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
U.S. officials have said that the move will come by the end of next year  but  Trumpâs  wording made clear that the entire embassy  with  its  heavy security demands  will not move right away.
The Jerusalem move upended decades of U.S. policy that set the status of Jerusalem as undecided and a matter for mutual agreement by Israel and the Palestinians.  Trump âs willingness to withdraw funding for the Palestinians is also a departure from long-standing U.S. policy that sent millions to the Palestinian Authority and other agencies for schools  economic development projects and other support to Palestinians in the West Bank and elsewhere.
 Trump  said past efforts were too timid in using U.S. contributions as leverage.  He  also suggested past U.S. negotiators were also too hidebound in their view of Jerusalem.
âThis was never brought up by other negotiators  but itâs brought up by me. So I will say that the hardest subject they had to talk about was Jerusalem. We took Jerusalem off the table  so we donât have to talk about it anymore. They never got past Jerusalem. We took it off the table. We donât have to talk about it anymore. You won one point  and youâll give up some points later on in the negotiation  if it ever takes place. I donât know that it ever will take place â  Trump  said to Netanyahu.
The two leaders met on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here  with an agenda that included future U.S. participation in the international nuclear deal with Iran. Netanyahu told  Trump  that he would back the United States if Washington walks away from the agreement that both leaders say is too weak.
 Trump  also met Thursday with British Prime Minister Theresa May  who broke with the U.S. leader over  his  retweet of far-right anti-Muslim videos.  Trump  took the opportunity to tell reporters that reported tension between them was just a âfalse rumor.â
 Trump  was scathing in  his  criticism of Palestinian leaders  who have not spoken with any senior U.S. officials since Trumpâs Dec. 6 announcement about Jerusalem. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. The area was annexed by Israel after the 1967 war with Arab states.
 Trump  has never been specific about whether  he  considers East Jerusalem to also be âoff the tableâ in future negotiations  and  he  did not answer shouted questions about that point on Thursday. But  his  wording and  his  reference to future Israeli trade-offs suggest that  he  considers  the city âs status to be settled business at least for now.","[TGT] met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  on   [TGT]  .

5170,Trump Made the Most Flagrant Bigots Proud. They See Him as Their Leader. Why Wouldnât They ?,Trump,"I know itâs hard to keep up  but this morning  President Donald Trump  did something so dangerous  offensive  and problematic that it must be confronted head-on. In my circles  we are wary of playing what we call the âOppression Olympics â where one horrible moment of bigotry gets ranked against the next  but I am forced to say that what  Trump  did this morning is a low moment for a very low presidency.
As he does most mornings   Trump  woke up and began  his  daily tweet-fest. Each tweet could be legitimately critiqued and dissected.

I truly believe that  Trump  â who  I remind you  is the president of the United States and has over 44 million followers on Twitter alone â has just endangered millions of people.
 Trump  has just endangered millions of people.  The videos Trump promoted  are pieces of hateful  anti-Muslim propaganda.
 Trump  retweeted several videos from a group called Britain First  a far-right  white supremacist group.  The videos Trump promoted  are pieces of hateful  anti-Muslim propaganda. One of  the videos   purporting to be of a young Muslim immigrant assaulting a young Dutch man  appears to be an absolute hoax. There is no indication that the perpetrator of the attack is a Muslim. As my colleague Rob Mackey wrote  Britain First has a long history of distorting videos and releasing misleading information to promote its hateful cause; the group is a purveyor of bigoted hoaxes.
On Wednesday  Fransen was thrilled with Trumpâs retweets  posting an all-caps message about it: âDONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS RETWEETED THESE VIDEOS AND HAS AROUND 44 MILLION FOLLOWERS! GOD BLESS YOU  TRUMP ! GOD BLESS AMERICA!â she wrote. After thanking Trump  Fransen then went on a tweeting spree  in which she appears to openly accept that the videos were hateful  Islamophobic  and anti-Muslim.

5171,Trump 's SOTU Unifying Despite Nationalistic Approach,Trump,"Donald Trump  gave a notably unifying State of the Union address that didn't back down an inch from  his  controversial nationalism.
This doesn't represent a contradiction  but a step toward fulfilling the political promise of his nationalism  which could appeal much more broadly than to  Trump 's devoted base.
It should believe government exists to serve the nation  not the other way around. Or as  Trump  put it: ""Americans love their country. And they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.""
To say  Trump  has often fallen short of these standards is an understatement. Nationalism is not yelling at rallies  tweeting inflammatory messages or insulting political adversaries. It is an American tradition that runs through Alexander Hamilton  Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.
""The metonymic image of banal nationalism "" Billig writes  ""is not a flag which is being consciously waved with fervent passion; it is the flag hanging unnoticed on the public building."" To extend the metaphor   Trump  noticed the flag when other political players neglected it.
This gives  Trump  running room  and  his  State of the Union usefully trafficked in banal nationalism.
 Trump  hailed 12-year-old Preston Sharp for leading an effort to place flags on veterans' graves  saying it ""reminds us why we salute our flag  why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance  and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.""
How can anyone disagree  unless he has been cornered into maintaining the opposite out of outrage at  Trump 's intervention in the NFL kneeling protests?
 Trump  said  ""As president of the United States  my highest loyalty  my greatest compassion and my constant concern is for America's children  America's struggling workers and America's forgotten communities.""
You could hear the teeth-grinding among Democrats when  Trump  declared  in a reference to the DREAM Act  ""Americans are dreamers  too."" The line had all the subversive  common-sense potential of saying  ""All lives matter "" when the left insisted it was only permissible to say  ""Black lives matter.""
Immigration is such a flashpoint in the  Trump  era because it is the hot-button domestic policy issue that most directly involves the clash of world views between cosmopolitans (who care most about the interests of immigrants) and nationalists (who care most about the interests of people already here).
 Trump  took Reagan's old trope of recognizing exemplary people in the House gallery and stretched it to its maximum possible extent. The speech was almost a long disquisition on ordinary heroes  each illustrating a theme of the speech. It was a long way from ""I alone can fix it.""
 He  ended  his  speech hailing people from all walks of life  saying that ""above all else  they are Americans. And this Capitol  this city  and this Nation  belong to them.""
If  he  resolved to routinely live up to the sentiments of the State of the Union   he 'd do  himself  and our political culture immeasurable good. Politically  it isn't  Trump  the alleged tool of the Russians or Trump the budding dictator that Democrats have to fear most;  it 's Trump the nationalist unifier.","[TGT] gave a notably unifying State of the Union address that didn't back down an inch from   [TGT]   controversial nationalism.

""The metonymic image of banal nationalism "" Billig writes  ""is not a flag which is being consciously waved with fervent passion; it is the flag hanging unnoticed on the public building."" To extend the metaphor   Trump  noticed the flag when other political players neglected it.
This gives   [TGT] running room  and   [TGT]   State of the Union usefully trafficked in banal nationalism.
  [TGT] hailed 12-year-old Preston Sharp for leading an effort to place flags on veterans' graves  saying it ""reminds us why we salute our flag  why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance  and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.""
How can anyone disagree  unless he has been cornered into maintaining the opposite out of outrage at   [TGT]  's intervention in the NFL kneeling protests?
  [TGT] said  ""As president of the United States  my highest loyalty  my greatest compassion and my constant concern is for America's children  America's struggling workers and America's forgotten communities.""
You could hear the teeth-grinding among Democrats when   [TGT] declared  in a reference to the DREAM Act  ""Americans are dreamers  too."" The line had all the subversive  common-sense potential of saying  ""All lives matter "" when the left insisted it was only permissible to say  ""Black lives matter.""
Immigration is such a flashpoint in the   [TGT]   era because it is the hot-button domestic policy issue that most directly involves the clash of world views between cosmopolitans (who care most about the interests of immigrants) and nationalists (who care most about the interests of people already here).
  [TGT] took Reagan's old trope of recognizing exemplary people in the House gallery and stretched it to its maximum possible extent. The speech was almost a long disquisition on ordinary heroes  each illustrating a theme of the speech. It was a long way from ""I alone can fix it.""
 He  ended  his  speech hailing people from all walks of life  saying that ""above all else  they are Americans. And this Capitol  this city  and this Nation  belong to them.""
If  he  resolved to routinely live up to the sentiments of the State of the Union   he 'd do  himself  and our political culture immeasurable good. Politically  it isn't   [TGT] the alleged tool of the Russians or Trump the budding dictator that Democrats have to fear most;  it 's Trump the nationalist unifier.",Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Negative,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,,

The sparkle of the holiday season comes to the White House every year  but  Donald Trump  had promised the country more than twinkling lights and decked halls. As a candidate on the campaign trail   he  pledged to end the perceived âWar on Christmas.â
âYou go to stores  you donât see the word Christmas â  Trump  said last year. âIt says âhappy holidaysâ all over. I say  âWhereâs Christmas?â I tell my wife  âDonât go to those stores.â . . . I want to see Christmas.â
 Melania Trump  seemed to be taking cues from  her  husbandâs desire for a traditional notion of Christmas when  she  unveiled the White House holiday decorations on Monday. It was all doused with an extra smattering of  Trump -style cheer:

Gone were the âSeasonâs Greetingsâ that the Obama family placed on their Christmas cards. The Trump familyâs official Christmas card reads: âMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year.â The dominant color scheme is an old-school red  green and gold. And the official hashtag? #WHChristmas.
 The first lady  made a Hollywood entrance into the holiday press preview  gliding down the Grand Staircase from the private quarters onto the state floor as ballerinas finished dancing to âThe Nutcracker Suiteâ played by the Marine Band. Dressed in an off-white dress and glittering gold stilettos   she  posed in front of trees laden with snow  icicles and glass nutcrackers  a tribute to the White Houseâs 1961 âNutcrackerâ Christmas theme.
Then  she  proceeded to make crafts with children from Joint Base Andrews  going from room to room assembling gumdrop trees and coloring holiday cards. Although there were no formal comments from  the first lady   you could hear  her  chatting with the children about their plans for Christmas  their pets and what was on their lists to Santa.
 Her  vision for  her  familyâs first holiday at the White House was about âclassic Christmas decor â according to a statement that said  she  was involved in selecting âevery detailâ of the decorations. What was described as Melania Trumpâs âsignature Christmas wreathsâ (white pine circles with red bows) were placed on the exterior White House windows. The same simple wreaths in miniature decorate the official gingerbread house  which depicts the southern exterior of the mansion.
â She  is now becoming the first lady of the house and  she âs taking care of the house â said Paolo Zampolli  a friend of the Trumps who visited the White House at Halloween and will return for a Christmas party.
In the White Houseâs official illustrated Christmas 2017 tour book  âTime Honored Traditions â 11-year-old Barron Trump wanders through the decked-out public rooms in a blue blazer and red scarf. But there seem to be no other personal touches or clues as to what a Trump family Christmas is all about.
[I feel so good about myself doing thisâ:  President Trump  pardons  his  first turkey]
 The first lady  has followed a number of seasonal traditions set by predecessors. Before Thanksgiving  Melania and Barron Trump stepped onto the North driveway of the White House to receive an 18Â½-foot Balsam fir that was later placed in the Blue Room. The tree was trimmed with blue and gold ornaments bearing seals from all the states and territories.
There have  however  been a few hiccups in Trumpâs attempt to make Christmas great again. The formal invitations to the series of White House parties hosted for friends  supporters  staff and the press corps went out this month with some messaging underneath the gold presidential seal that sent political media cackling. Rather than calling the event a White House âChristmas partyâ the invitationâs curly script reads  yes  âHoliday Reception.â
Meanwhile  the âofficial Merry Christmas hatâ that is offered for sale by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee had liberals howling. Embroidered with Christmas lights  the red âMake America Great Againâ baseball cap says âMerry Christmasâ on the back. At $45  itâs holiday capitalism at its best.
In other ways  the White House celebration of the season is a continuation of age-old traditions. Beginning in the 20th century  Americans began to focus on the White House during the holidays  said Evan Phifer  a research historian at the White House Historical Association. In 1923  Calvin Coolidge was  the first president to walk from the White House to the Ellipse to light the National Christmas tree . Every president has done that in the decades since.  President Trump  will light the tree on Thursday.","[TGT] welcomed children to the White House on Nov. 27  and was mobbed with hugs from one group.

5173,These Veterans Say Trump's Military Parade Would Be A Big Waste Of Time,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON â For the soldiers  sailors  airmen and Marines who would be tasked with making it happen  a military parade like  the one President Donald Trump  reportedly envisions would be a colossal pain in the rear guard.
 Trump  has long fantasized about being in the center of a celebration involving thousands of soldiers marching in formation alongside tanks and missile launchers. And in January  after watching 6 000 soldiers march through Paris last summer to commemorate a turning point in the French Revolution   he  told military brass to start planning a parade âlike the one in France â The Washington Post reported Tuesday.
Charles Platiau / Reuters A scene from the 2017 Bastille Day parade in France that reportedly inspired  President Donald Trump  to request a military parade in the U.S.
There are some regiments in the D.C. area with service members who are well-trained in marching and ceremonies. The 3rd U.S. Infantry  known as the Old Guard  conducts ceremonies at the White House and the Pentagon  maintains a 24-hour vigil at the Tomb of the Unknowns  and provides military funeral escorts at Arlington National Cemetery. But a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue consisting only of troops from the Old Guard would look âlaughably small â said Jonathan Hollis  who served in special operations forces and completed four deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. âItâs not what  Trump  has in mind.â
Preparation for a parade of the scale  Trump  seems to want would require participants to practice for about a week in advance  several current and former members of the military estimated.
If  Trump  wanted the militaryâs biggest  most badass-looking military equipment on display during the parade  it would likely require the participation of active duty service members who are either preparing for deployment or have recently returned from a combat zone. National Guardsmen have some heavy equipment  but their weaponry tends to be older â and unless  Trump  federalized the National Guard for the purposes of his parade  he would need a governor to volunteer the stateâs troops.
 Trump  still doesnât have the faintest idea of what meaningful patriotism looks like. Luke Thomas
 Trump  would probably want  his  military parade to outdo the one  he  attended in France. That means  he  would ask for equipment like tanks  mobile missile launchers and anti-aircraft rocket launchers â much of which is located on bases in states like North Carolina  Georgia and Texas.
Some veterans considered it particularly absurd that  Trump   who dodged military service and mocked a prisoner of war during the campaign  would order a military parade.

5174,If Republicans believe Roy Mooreâs accusers why not Trumpâs?,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump  2016 Republican presidential nominee  pauses while speaking during a campaign rally at the Venetian Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on Oct. 30  2016. (Eric Thayer/Bloomberg News)
Specifically  if you believe the women accusing Roy Moore  the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama  why did you ignore the women who accused  presidential candidate Donald Trump ? If youâre troubled by Mooreâs alleged behavior  why were you so nonchalant about Trumpâs?
Since the Harvey Weinstein story broke almost six weeks ago  the matter of  Trump âs conduct has been festering beneath the surface of most public discussion. Indeed  Trumpâs reported behavior is more like that of Weinstein than Moore. Both businessmen were accused of using their power in the marketplace to obtain â or coerce  especially in Weinsteinâs case â sexual favors.
And in Trumpâs case? Much the same. Consider the account of Kristin Anderson  who told The Post that  at a Manhattan nightclub in the early 1990s   Trump  reached under  her  skirt and touched  her  vagina through  her  underwear â much as  Trump  described behaving in the âAccess Hollywoodâ tape.
Consider the account of former People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff  who described how  while on a 2005 reporting trip to Mar-a-Lago to interview  Trump  and  his  then-pregnant wife   Trump  âshut the door behind us . . . and within seconds  he  was pushing me against the wall and forcing  his  tongue down my throat.â
Trumpâs response  as characteristic as it was unconvincing  was the same as Mooreâs: total denial. âEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign â  he  said in October 2016. âTotal fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.â
The Moore situation backs Republicans  and the  Trump  White House  into an even more uncomfortable corner.
Of course the most credible explanation is both obvious and unspeakable in public: Republicans can afford to throw Moore under the bus  as difficult as it would be to narrow their already-thin Senate majority. They could not risk losing the presidency  even if it meant electing  Trump .
If Republicans as a whole are in a difficult spot  imagine the White House pickle. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  with others in tow  has sided with Mooreâs accusers. Having deployed the if-then approach with Moore â if he behaved as alleged  then he should withdraw â what does  Trump  now say? âIâm unconvinced  even if McConnell & Co. believe themâ? Or  âOkay  Iâm convinced  too â in which case the question arises: And so what about the women who accused you?
One last point  for the what-about-ists out there. Yes  there are serious questions about Bill Clintonâs behavior with women. I said they were fair game back in the campaign  when he was deployed as a chief surrogate for Hillary Clinton and she was complaining about  Trump âs âpenchant for sexism.â
But now  give  it  a rest. Bill Clinton is not the president. Hillary Clinton is not the president.  Trump  is. Heâs the one whose conduct  present and past  remains relevant  and for which he and his party should finally be held to account.","[TGT] pauses while speaking during a campaign rally at the Venetian Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on Oct. 30  2016.

5175,Trump calls Japan 'crucial ally' as he kicks off Asia trip,Trump,"FUSSA  Japan (AP) â  President Donald Trump  praised Japan as a âtreasured partnerâ and âcrucial allyâ Sunday  as  he  kicked off a grueling and consequential first trip to Asia.
 Trump  landed at Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo  where  he  was greeted by cheers from service members.  Trump  then donned a bomber jacket for a speech in which  he  touted American firepower and the U.S. alliance with Japan.
âJapan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States and today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations â  he  said  speaking in front of an American flag inside an airplane hangar.
âOn behalf of the United States of America  I send the warmest wishes of the America people to the citizens of this remarkable country â  he  said.
After the speech   Trump  was set to head to a private golf course for an informal lunch and golf with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
 Trump  was expected to exhort allies and rivals to step up efforts to counter the dangers posed by North Koreaâs nuclear threat. Before  he  landed   Trump  used the first moments of  his  trip to denounce North Korea as âa big problemâ that must âbe solved.â
âThereâs been 25 years of total weakness  so we are taking a very much different approachâ in dealing with the renegade regime in Pyongyang â  he  said  speaking to reporters on Air Force One.
Some regional analysts have speculated that Trumpâs presence in Asia may prompt North Korea to take provocative action  like a missile test.  Trump   when asked about that possibility  said âweâll soon find out.â
The 12-day  five-country trip  the longest Far East itinerary for a president in a generation  comes at a precarious moment for  Trump . Just days ago  his former campaign chairman was indicted and another adviser pleaded guilty as part of an investigation into possible collusion between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.
It will pose a test for  Trump âs stamina â but  Trump  assured reporters aboard Air Force that  he  was up for the task. âItâs grueling  they tell me  but fortunately thatâs historically not been a problem for me. One thing you people will say  thatâs not been a problem â he said.
It also presents a crucial international test for a president looking to reassure Asian allies worried that his inward-looking âAmerica Firstâ agenda could cede power in the region to China. They also are rattled by his bellicose rhetoric about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Northâs growing missile arsenal threatens the capitals  Trump  will visit.
Trumpâs spontaneous  and at time reckless  style flies in the face of the generations-old traditions and protocol that govern diplomatic exchanges in Asia. The grand receptions expected for him in Tokyo  Seoul  Beijing and beyond are sure to be lavish attempts to impress the president  who raved about the extravagances shown him on earlier visits to Saudi Arabia and France.
The trip will also put  Trump  in face-to-face meetings with authoritarian leaders for whom he has expressed admiration. They include Chinaâs Xi Jinping  whom  Trump  has likened to âa king â and the Philippinesâ Rodrigo Duterte  who has sanctioned the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers.
 Trump  is also expected to have a second private audience with Russian President Vladimir Putin  on the sidelines of a summit in Vietnam.
 He  told reporters that the meeting is âexpectedâ to happen and that  he  âwill want Putinâs helpâ in dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis.  Trump  and Putin could cross paths twice during the presidentâs lengthy Asia trip: at a summit in Vietnam and later in the Philippines. It was unclear where  they  would meet.

5177,Trump defends Melania on shoes clothes for hurricane trips,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump in an interview with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee defended the first lady over backlash she received for wearing stiletto heels before boarding flights to hurricane-ravaged areas.

 The president  told Huckabee that the first lady had dressed up ""out of respect for the White House "" adding that  she  ""wants to look good leaving the front entrance.""
 He  continued: ""So  she  dresses up  and  she  puts on formal shoes  high heels  and  she  leaves the White House going to Texas  or going to wherever we want to go â Florida  actually twice. So walking through that front door   she  did. Now   she  has sneakers in the meantime with  her  so  she  can change into other clothing when we're walking through where a hurricane is just leaving  and  she  took tremendous abuse.""
 Trump  added that people  he  has met have not appeared to mind the first lady's heels.
""But the good news is that the people understand it â I was making a speech  and women were holding up â 'we love your stilettos.' They really do love  her . And  she 's a good person ""  Trump  said.

5180,How Trump Can (and Probably Will) Botch the Iran Situation,Donald Trump,"It took about a day for  Donald Trump  to insert  himself  into the situation.
On Friday   the president  took to Twitter to laud the protests as a sign Iranians were fed up with their government for its âsquandering of the national wealth to fund terrorism abroad.â And  he âs continued sounding off about the protests since  in part by bashing  his  predecessorâs Iran policiesâthe Obama administration was famously rather hands-off during the 2009 âGreen Movement â the last major outbreak of protests in the country  a strategic decision then secretary of state Hillary Clinton came to regret. On Wednesday   Trump  went so far as to suggest  his  administration may take some sort of action in support of the protesters âat the appropriate time â though as usual with  him   itâs awfully difficult to know what this actually means.
Trumpâs fixation on the protests isnât surprising. As always   he  seems determined to use the issue to show  he âs bigger and better than Obama. Practically speaking   he  could conceivably take this opportunity to re-impose sanctions the last administration lifted in 2015 in exchange for a freeze on Iranâs nuclear program. (The waiver on those sanctions needs to be renewed every few months  and the next deadline is coming up in just over a week.) Key Trump allies have also been talking openly about adopting an explicit policy of undermining the Iranian government and pushing for regime change.
VICE: When these protests broke out  given everything we know about him  how did you expect  Trump  to react?
Jamal Abdi: My fear was that  Trump  would exploit [this] for  his  policy agenda that  his  administration was hoping to push forward for a long time... that  Trump  [might] use this to kill the nuclear deal and change US policy firmly towards regime change in Iran. Which I donât think will lead to regime change. It could lead to war. But more likely  it will lead to a situation in Iran where thereâs a more severe clampdownâ¦ and the prospect of moving towards more open governance and greater human rights becomes even more reduced because of tensions with the United States.
I donât think the rhetoric has factored into the Iranian response yet. Probably that will change if  Trump  decides to not [continue to] waive sanctions. I see that as an opportunity for Iranâs leaders to say  Look  the United States is behind the economic grievances that sparked these protests.
 Trump  has said nice things about the Iranian people  that theyâve been held back by their current system of government. But thatâs rhetorical. You couple that with new policies like piling on sanctions that actually will hurt Iranians and the fact that  Trump  is banning all Iranians from coming to the United States and it rings hallow in Iran. I donât think many Iranians are looking at  Trump  as someone they want as the leading voice of whatever this movement ends up being.
 Trump  has exacerbated that  because now people [think] the US could really try to get involved. Then other players may want to get involved. Iâve heard people talk about this fear of  What if the Saudis try to get involved and send weapons into Iran? That has made a lot of people who were maybe involved in the 2009 protests or who want changes to say  I donât want to get involved because Iâm afraid what could happen with  Trump  and other outside actors if this goes too far.
What will happen in Iran if  Trump  pulls out of the nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions?
The nuclear deal is one of Hassan Rouhaniâs [the moderate who won Iranâs presidency in 2013] only major achievements. It was supposed to bring economic prosperity. It hasnât  and the majority of Iranians view it as a failure because they donât see their lives getting better. If  Trump  does this  it will pull the rug out from under the Rouhani government and any hope diplomacy and moderation can make things better and will give the hardliners cover to take over.
In the short-term  if  Trump  reacts with sanctions that go against the economic concerns of the protestors  will that make it hard for the regime to argue  as it often does when unrest breaks out  that the people on the street are being funded or stoked by America?
This is probably an opportunity for what  Trump  wants to do that  his  administration is not going to let go of  even if the protests fizzle out. They are going to use this to try to push the US into a full regime-change policy. Thatâs where I expect things to lead  unfortunately.","It took about a day for   [TGT] to insert   [TGT]   into the situation.

5181,Trumpâs State of the Union: A diatribe against immigrants,Trump,"President Trumpâs State of the Union address was the perfect reflection of him â self-satisfied  self-congratulatory  disingenuous and entirely lacking in empathy. âThere has never been a better time to start living the American dream â he declared  as if the dystopia of the Barack Obama years â that bleak  losing  crime-ridden nightmare â had vanished in a short year to be replaced by nirvana. And if you are white and rich  he had a point.
Many  if not most  Democrats remained glum with arms crossed and withheld applause as he entered and during his draggy speech.

It is the sort of thing a normal president  one who had actually attempted to bring the country together rather than investigate his political opponent  wage war on the free press  demonize immigrants  launch a smear campaign against the FBI and accuse  his predecessor of criminality (wiretapping Trump Tower)  would have said.

What if the American public  not President Trump  defined the State of the Union address? The Washington Post Opinions section asked you to finish this sentence: ""The state of the union is _____."" Here's what some of you said. (Adriana Usero Danielle Kunitz/The Washington Post)
And then on cue came the meat of the speech: Demonizing immigrants. When  he  declared  âStruggling communities  especially immigrant communities  will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families â  he  would have us believe  he  had not eradicated DACA  had not doubled the deportation of noncriminal illegal immigrants and not understood a single economic study finding immigrants contribute to our society by starting more businesses  committing fewer crimes and owning more homes (by percentage) than the native-born population.  He  utterly rejects the notion that America is the land of immigrants â the place made prosperous and dynamic by those who come here from elsewhere.
And sure enough  he  played the âimmigrants take from usâ card (âmy highest loyalty  my greatest compassion  and my constant concern is for Americaâs children  Americaâs struggling workers and Americaâs forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to riseâ). It never dawns on  him  that immigrants do benefit our children and struggling workers and are an essential part of a pro-growth agenda. And in yet another scare-mongering tactic  he  blamed the visa lottery for terrorist attacks: âIn recent weeks  two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.â For those who care to recall the facts  these terrorists were radicalized after years being here and  therefore  do not implicate the lottery system.
The amount of time devoted to this topic and the resumption of scare tactics confirm immigration restriction and xenophobia (there was the mandatory MS-13 reference) remain centerpieces of the GOP agenda.  He  also falsely insisted chain migration â that would be family reunification â is bringing in hordes of immigrants â âunlimitedâ numbers in fact! Even for  him   thatâs an outrageous misstatement.
As one would expect   he  equated economic success with the stock market (which dropped more than 300 points today) and claimed credit for three million (!) bonuses; no mention was made of the layoffs or stock buybacks.  He  exaggerated  his  job record. NBC chimed in with a fact check: âTrumpâs first year in office was marked by 2.1 million jobs being added to the economy â the slowest year of job growth in six years â while the other job gains came under President Barack Obama. Wages are indeed rising  but they were not exactly stagnate. Theyâve been rising steadily for years  according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.â
Beyond taking credit for the economy that was already on an upward trajectory when  he  arrived   his  domestic accomplishments are so few that  he  was forced to fill space with anecdotes that have literally nothing to do with  him  (e.g.  a boy putting flags on veteransâ graves) or to speak of  his  plans to do things  with little indication as to how  he  will accomplish them. (âOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries  these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.â)
 He  did sound the call for an infrastructure bill. (âI am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and  where appropriate  tapping into private sector investment â to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process â getting it down to no more than two years  and perhaps even one.â) Republicans seemed unenthusiastic. One wonders how his presidency would have been different had he started his term with this rather than a failed effort to repeal Obamacare.
His discussion of foreign policy was perfunctory but also entirely undistinguished aside from a pledge to keep Guantanamo Bay open (did anyone think heâd do anything different?)  a call for more military funding  praise for progress on fighting the Islamic State and threatening foreign aid. He did NOT call for an end to the Iran nuclear deal but instead offered: âI am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.â It seems saner heads have prevailed on the issue. Most surprising was his focus on human rights atrocities in North Korea and his lack of bombastic threats. Both were appropriate. The parents of Otto Warmbier  the American student who died of abuse in the hands of North Korean captives  was certainly moving. Ji Seong-ho  a refugee from torture in North Korea who traveled on crutches to escape  was an unintentional reminder of how perverse it is to keep immigrants out. Would America not benefit by his permanent presence?  Trump  apparently finds  him  admirable only insofar as  he  lives elsewhere. Finally  one could only marvel at how  his  speechwriters could have claimed  Trump  has improved our standing abroad.  He  uttered the word âRussiaâ once â in passing.
The speech was far too long â or maybe just boring when it was not being insulting and inflammatory on immigration. With so few actual accomplishments the speech felt padded. With the exception of  his  determination to paint immigrants as a danger and a drag on America (in the face of all evidence to the contrary) it was rather ordinary. An on-message Trump is a dull  Trump .

Beyond taking credit for the economy that was already on an upward trajectory when  he  arrived   his  domestic accomplishments are so few that  he  was forced to fill space with anecdotes that have literally nothing to do with  him  (e.g.  a boy putting flags on veteransâ graves) or to speak of  his  plans to do things  with little indication as to how  he  will accomplish them. (âOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries  these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.â)
 He  did sound the call for an infrastructure bill. (âI am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and  where appropriate  tapping into private sector investment â to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process â getting it down to no more than two years  and perhaps even one.â) Republicans seemed unenthusiastic. One wonders how his presidency would have been different had he started his term with this rather than a failed effort to repeal Obamacare.
His discussion of foreign policy was perfunctory but also entirely undistinguished aside from a pledge to keep Guantanamo Bay open (did anyone think heâd do anything different?)  a call for more military funding  praise for progress on fighting the Islamic State and threatening foreign aid. He did NOT call for an end to the Iran nuclear deal but instead offered: âI am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.â It seems saner heads have prevailed on the issue. Most surprising was his focus on human rights atrocities in North Korea and his lack of bombastic threats. Both were appropriate. The parents of Otto Warmbier  the American student who died of abuse in the hands of North Korean captives  was certainly moving. Ji Seong-ho  a refugee from torture in North Korea who traveled on crutches to escape  was an unintentional reminder of how perverse it is to keep immigrants out. Would America not benefit by his permanent presence?   [TGT] apparently finds  him  admirable only insofar as   [TGT]   lives elsewhere. Finally  one could only marvel at how   [TGT]   speechwriters could have claimed   [TGT] has improved our standing abroad.   [TGT]   uttered the word âRussiaâ once â in passing.
The speech was far too long â or maybe just boring when it was not being insulting and inflammatory on immigration. With so few actual accomplishments the speech felt padded. With the exception of  his  determination to paint immigrants as a danger and a drag on America (in the face of all evidence to the contrary) it was rather ordinary.  [TGT]  is a dull  Trump .

In late July  the White House had just finished an official policy review on transgender individuals serving in the military and President Trump and his then-chief of staff  Reince Priebus  had agreed to meet in the Oval Office to discuss the four options awaiting the president in a decision memo.
But then  Trump  unexpectedly preempted the conversation and sent  his  entire administration scrambling  by tweeting out  his  own decision â that the government would not allow transgender individuals to serve â just moments later.
â âOh my God   he  just tweeted this â â Priebus said  according to a new book by Howard Kurtz  who hosts Fox Newsâs âMedia Buzz.â There was  Kurtz writes  âno longer a need for the meeting.â
The White House â and the politerati diaspora â has just barely stopped reeling from author Michael Wolffâs account of life in  Trump âs West Wing  âFire and Fury: Inside  the Trump White House  â and now another life-in-the-White-House book is about to drop  this one from Kurtz.
Like the books that came before it  and almost certainly like the ones still to come  Kurtzâs book  âMedia Madness:  Donald Trump   The Press  And The War Over The Truth â offers a portrait of a White House riven by chaos  with aides scrambling to respond to the presidentâs impulses and writing policy to fit his tweets  according to excerpts obtained by The Washington Post.
Stephen K. Bannon isnât the only person offering a candid assessment about the  Trump  administration in the book âFire and Fury: Inside  the Trump White House â by Michael Wolff. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)
Kurtz  who worked at The Post from 1981 to 2010  writes that  Trumpâs  aides even privately coined a term for  Trumpâs  behavior â âDefiance Disorder.â The phrase refers to  Trumpâs  seeming compulsion to do whatever it is  his  advisers are most strongly urging against  leaving  his  team to handle the fallout.
Early in the administration  Kurtz describes White House aides waking up one Saturday morning in March  confused and âblindsided â to find that  Trump  had â without any evidence â accused former president Barack Obama on Twitter of wiretapping him during the campaign.
In another scene  Kurtz paints a largely positive picture of Trumpâs daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law  Jared Kushner  but notes â as has been previously reported â that  Trump  repeatedly worried whether the couple were making the right decision moving to Washington to take jobs in  his  administration.
 Trump  had reason for concern. At one point  Kurtz writes that Stephen K. Bannon â Trumpâs former chief strategist who was a key on-the-record source for Wolffâs book and seems likely to have talked to Kurtz â dresses down the presidentâs daughter early in the administration.
Kurtz also recounts an Oval Office meeting in which Bannon blamed Ivanka for a leak â and  Trump  supported him over his daughter: â âBaby  I think Steveâs right here â  Trump  told  her .â
Bannon  Kurtz writes  told  Trump  when he left the White House in August that he planned to go after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)  saying his main goal was âto bring him down.â
â Trump  said that was fine  that Bannon should go ahead â Kurtz writes.
By Kurtzâs telling  Trumpâs approach to replacing Priebus as chief of staff with John F. Kelly  who was then homeland security secretary  was also not exactly standard operating procedure. âTypically   Trump  announced the decision without telling Priebus and without having made a formal offer to Kelly â he writes.
In the excerpts  counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway emerges as one of the few calming presences on  Trump . When  on his first full day as president   Trump  wanted to send Sean Spicer  then the White House press secretary  out to attack the media for correctly reporting the crowd size  Conway initially tried to talk him out of it.","[TGT] seen here in a file photo  is portrayed in another new book as running a chaotic White House.

One of the ripest targets is Del. Tim Hugo (R-40)  a long-entrenched incumbent thanks to the tons of money he gets from such questionable allies as the predatory lending industry and our power monopoly Dominion Energy.
Honestly  it started with November 2016. Like most people  we saw what happens when we were apathetic to the process.

I think I would pose a thought. While most of the country was probably disappointed as I was the day after the election   he  did bring out something in all of us  where we were realizing how frustrated we were with politics the way itâs been conducted.

5189,U.S. top court mulls whether to take up 'Dreamers' dispute,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday discussed in private how to handle President  Donald Trump âs appeal of a judgeâs decision blocking  his  plan to end protections for young illegal immigrants dubbed âDreamers â and the nine justices could announce as early as Tuesday whether they will take up the case.
On Tuesday  a second U.S. judge issued a similar injunction ordering the  Trump  administration to keep DACA in place.
In a Twitter post on Friday   Trump  sought to blame Democrats for the problems created by  his  order  writing  âCannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.â
Trumpâs move to rescind DACA prompted legal challenges by Democratic state attorneys general and various organizations and individuals in multiple federal courts.

5190,Trump Returns to the Script in Las Vegas,Trump,"âMany families tonight will go to bed in a world that is suddenly empty â  Trump  said. âThe people they so dearly love were torn away from them forever. Our souls are stricken with grief for every American who lost a husband or a wife  a mother or a father  a son or a daughter. We know that your sorrow feels endless. we stand together to help you carry your pain. You are not alone. We will never leave your side.â
 Trump  spoke at length about the bravery of police officers who worked to stop alleged shooter Stephen Paddock and to save others at the concert.
Though  Trump  remains stiff in this mode  and appears to prefer speaking off-the-cuff  these were among his best moments of speaking as president. It is true that he has lowered the bar with frequent  cringeworthy comments  but his speech at Vegas stuck narrowly to unifying themes and a goal of consoling the nation. Communicating this kind of empathy is a task that has often eluded  Trump   whether after violence in Charlottesville or in the wake of natural disasters.
This was particularly apparent in  Trumpâs  disastrous appearance in Puerto Rico on Tuesday  where he appeared more interested in celebrating himself  downplayed the scope of Hurricane Maria  underestimated the death toll  and delivered a boastful digression about the F-35. Later  he was photographed tossing paper towels into a crowd at an aid-distribution center.
The idea that  Trump  can âbecome presidentialâ has become a deservedly mocked clichÃ© of presidential punditry. But as in other situations  there is and will be no  Trump  pivot. He is not obviously growing into the role of president  as many Republicans and pundits optimistically hoped he would.  Trump  is  Trump . The difference is simply whether he sticks to prepared remarks or prospects into murkier territory. The key Wednesday was that for  Trump   what happened in Vegas stayed on script. When  Trump  stays on script   his  remarks tend to go smoothly  even if  he  does not reach for the soaring oratory of a Reagan  Clinton  or Obama. When  he  goes off script or works without a script  it can get turbulent. (Earlier in the day   he  said at the Las Vegas police department  âIt could have been a whole lot worse â which is both true and a little tone-deaf  given the scale of death.)
Perhaps it should not come as a surprise that Trumpâs smooth and poised reaction in Vegas came the day after the mess in Puerto Rico.  The president  has established a loose pattern  on display after Charlottesville in particular  in which  his  more disciplined appearances are followed by improvised  sometimes sloppy ones  and vice versa.
âWe struggle for the words to explain to our children how such evil can exist  how there can be such cruelty and such suffering â Trump said Wednesday. âBut we cannot be defined by the evil that threatens us or the violence that incites such terror. We are defined by our love  our caring  and courage.â Trump himself often struggles for the right words  but in Las Vegas   he  found them by emphasizing love and caring.","âMany families tonight will go to bed in a world that is suddenly empty â   [TGT] said. âThe people they so dearly love were torn away from them forever.

A day after backing down from releasing the full US government files on President John F. Kennedy's assassination   President Donald Trump  said  he  hoped ""to get just about everything"" released eventually.
""JFK Files are being carefully released. In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public!""  Trump  tweeted on Friday morning.
On Thursday   Trump  allowed only the partial release of a trove of documents that a law passed 25 years ago dictated must be made public  citing ""potentially irreversible harm"" to national security if  he  had released all the records.
The decision to limit the release of documents apparently came down to a last-minute decision  with US intelligence agencies scrambling to postpone the release that  Trump  had promised earlier on Twitter.","[TGT] says   [TGT]   hopes ""to get just about everything to the public"" eventually regarding JFK's assassination.

5192,Most Americans say Trump  Congress not doing enough to stop mass shootings Post,Trump,"More than 6 in 10 Americans fault Congress and  President Trump  for not doing enough to prevent mass shootings  according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll  with most Americans continuing to say these incidents are more reflective of problems identifying and addressing mental health issues than inadequate gun laws.
In a sign that this pressure may be weighing on  President Trump   the White House announced Monday that  he  is âsupportiveâ of efforts in Congress to improve background checks for gun purchases.
A 77 percent majority says Congress is not doing enough to prevent mass shootings and 62 percent say the same of  Trump   according to the poll. At least half feel âstronglyâ that Congress and  the president  have not taken adequate action. Majorities across party lines express frustration with Congress  while views of  Trump  are more divided. More than 8 in 10 Democrats and two-thirds of independents say  the president  is not doing enough. More than 6 in 10 Republicans say  Trump  is taking sufficient action to prevent mass shootings  although more than one-quarter of fellow partisans  28 percent  say  he  is not.
Any legislative or policy response to the Florida school shooting is expected to be limited â neither  Trump  nor Republican leaders in Congress have  for instance  shown support for proposals to restrict sales of military-style assault rifles. A similar proposal was pushed by President Barack Obama and Democratic congressional leaders in 2013 but failed to advance through Congress following the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown  Conn.
The debate over what Congress and  the president  should do in response to mass shootings is once again confronting Washington after Nikolas Cruz  19  allegedly killed 17 people at  his  former high school Wednesday  with authorities charging that  he  aimed  his  AR-15 assault-style rifle and fired round after round into classroom after classroom in one of the nationâs worst school shootings.","More than 6 in 10 Americans fault Congress and  President Trump  for not doing enough to prevent mass shootings  according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll  with most Americans continuing to say these incidents are more reflective of problems identifying and addressing mental health issues than inadequate gun laws.

5193,Trump Defends Roy Moore Amid Sexual Assault Allegations: ' He Totally Denies It',Trump,"President Trump  is defending Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore  who has been accused by multiple women of sexually assaulting them when they were teenagers and  Moore  was in  his  30s.
""I've looked at  his  record â it's terrible on crime  it's terrible on the border  it's terrible on the military  "" Trump  said of  Moore 's Democratic opponent  former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones. Jones is best known for prosecuting KKK members responsible for the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four young black girls  decades after that high-profile crime during the civil rights movement.
When asked about the allegations that  Moore  pursued multiple teenage girls while  he  was in  his  30s and an assistant district attorney in Alabama   Trump  responded that  Moore  ""totally denies it"" and pointed out that the allegations are from roughly 40 years ago.
 Trump 's argument in favor of  Moore  is similar to one  his  advisers have begun to make this week â a GOP vote  no matter the person  helps  Trump 's agenda and is better than a Democratic vote against tax cuts and other priorities â while still not explicitly saying  ""Vote for  Roy Moore .""
But other national GOP leaders haven't been as forgiving.  Moore  has been abandoned by the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National Committee following the accusations. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R-Ky.  House Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  and other national Republicans have called on  Moore  to step aside  but the former state Supreme Court chief justice has refused. Some Republicans  including NRSC Chairman Sen. Cory Gardner  R-Colo.  have suggested  Moore  should be expelled from the Senate even if  he  is elected.
 Trump   McConnell and the NRSC backed  Moore 's primary opponent  appointed Sen. Luther Strange  in the GOP primary earlier this year to fill the seat of now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Trump  also said Tuesday  he  will announce next week whether  he  will campaign for  Moore   who has been endorsed by  Trump 's former chief strategist  Steve Bannon  as part of  his  ""war"" against the GOP establishment.
Several polls following the allegations against  Moore  showed  him  dropping as Jones took a lead ahead of the Dec. 12 special election. Even with the allegations against  Moore   Jones still faces an uphill climb in a state that hasn't sent a Democrat to the Senate in 25 years and where  Democratic strategists say  he needs independents and more moderate Republicans to cross over to vote for him.
Now Jones is using the words of  Trump  allies â including first daughter Ivanka â in his latest ad.  Ivanka Trump  said last week that  she  had ""no reason to doubt"" the accounts of the women accusing  Moore  of sexual misconduct and that ""there's a special place in hell for people who prey on children."" Sessions has also said he has ""no reason to doubt"" the women.
 Trump  was also accused of sexual assault by multiple women during the 2016 campaign  and  he  has continued to deny those allegations. But  he  has waded into other sexual assault allegations that have come to light recently against Democratic politicians  tweeting criticism of Sen. Al Franken  D-Minn.  last week.
Asked by reporters Tuesday whether Franken should resign   Trump  equivocated but did try to talk about a broader cultural moment of women feeling emboldened to come forward with accusations of various types of sexual misconduct  including sexual harassment and sexual assault â even as he declined to say he believes the women who have made allegations against  Moore .
""Women are very special  "" Trump  said. ""I think it's a very special time  a lot of things are coming out and I think that's good for our society and I think it's very very good for women and I'm very happy"" these things are coming out.
 Moore  has been accused by multiple women who say  he  pursued them romantically as teenagers when  he  was in  his  30s. The first woman to come forward was Leigh Corfman  who told the Washington Post that  Moore  initiated sexual contact with  her  when  she  was 14. Another woman  Gena Richardson  told the Post last week that  Moore  pursued her when she was working at the local mall  called her at her high school to ask her out and then later gave her a ""forceful"" unwanted kiss.
 Moore 's campaign has sought to discredit the stories of many of these women and held a news conference in Alabama Tuesday just ahead of Trump's impromptu remarks in support of  Moore . Campaign surrogates refused to take questions from the media  however  and  Moore  has not spoken publicly about the allegations since  he  spoke with Fox News host Sean Hannity on  his  radio show  where the Alabama GOP Senate nominee offered conflicting answers as to whether he had dated teen girls back in the late 1970s and early 1980s  when he would have been in his 30s.","[TGT] is defending Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore  who has been accused by multiple women of sexually assaulting them when they were teenagers and  Moore  was in  his  30s.

He is the bouncing ball that his audience sings along with â he is a wave  heâs not the water.
 Trump  has a sense of style â specifically   he  has Liberaceâs sense of style  all that phony gilding and those imitation Louis XV fauteuils and that hideous Alva Vanderbiltâstyle Fifth Avenue Bourbon pretense. But it is a style. In a political world full of men whose very souls wear blue blazers   Trump  is cheerfully shrugging off revelations about hush money paid to porn stars: The world is grown so bad that peacocks make prey where eagles dare not perch.
The Republican party has come a long way from Calvin Coolidge â a long way down. The GOP always has had its share of big talkers â Lincoln  Reagan â but it has become the Party That Wonât Shut Up  the party of Lewis Prothero and Lonesome Rhodes  Elmer Gantry denouncing those smart-aleck college professors   Donald Trump  seething about the losers and haters and preening about  his  ratings.

5195,Trump says 'only one thing will work' with North Korea,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump  on Saturday said âonly one thing will workâ in dealing with North Korea after previous administrations had talked to Pyongyang without results.
âPresidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years  agreements made and massive amounts of money paid â  Trump  said in a tweet. â...Hasnât worked  agreements violated before the ink was dry  making fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry  but only one thing will work!â
 Trump  did not make clear to what  he  was referring  but  his  comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on  his  mind.
 The president  has previously said the United States would âtotally destroyâ North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyangâs nuclear threats.
Earlier this week  during a meeting with top U.S. military leaders and their spouses   Trump  told reporters it was the âcalm before the storm.â Asked for clarification then on what  he  meant   Trump  said: âYouâll find out.â
Speaking to reporters on Saturday ahead of a trip to North Carolina   Trump  said  he  had nothing more to clarify.

Asked on Saturday about  Trump âs tweet  Sanders said she had nothing to add to the presidentâs comments.
 Trump  repeatedly has made clear  his  distaste for dialogue with North Korea. On Sunday  he  dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time  a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unâs government.
 Trump  said on Saturday that  he  had a good relationship with  his  secretary of state despite some disagreements.
âWe have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes Iâd like  him  to be a little bit tougher  but other than that we have a very good relationship â  he  said.","WASHINGTON   [TGT] on Saturday said âonly one thing will workâ in dealing with North Korea after previous administrations had talked to Pyongyang without results.

5196,Senate Republicans shove tax bill ahead as Democrats fume,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans rammed forward  President Donald Trumpâs  tax-cut bill on Tuesday in an abrupt  partisan committee vote that set up a full vote by the Senate as soon as Thursday  although some details of the measure remained unsettled.
After the vote   Trump  told reporters: âI think weâre going to get it passed â adding that it would have some adjustments.
Since  Trump  took office in January   he  and fellow Republicans in command of both chambers of Congress have approved no major legislation  a fact they want to change before facing voters in the 2018 congressional elections.
If the Senate approves its tax measure later this week  it would need to be reconciled with a version already approved by the House of Representatives before anything could be sent to the White House for  Trump  to sign into law.

5197,'Falling apart?' Trump 's insults not forgotten in Atlanta,Trump,"ATLANTA (AP) â When  President Donald Trump  swoops into Atlanta for a VIP seat at college footballâs biggest game   he âll enjoy the Southern hospitality of a city  he  disparaged a year ago as âfalling apartâ and âcrime infested.â
The insults tweeted by  Trump  a week before  his  inauguration may seem like ancient history to most Americans who follow the presidentâs voluminous stream of online invective. But Atlanta hasnât forgotten.
âIt was very personal because we live here and we love it â said Stephanie Langer  a 40-year-old East Atlanta resident whose anger over  the president âs putdowns was rekindled by news of  his  pending visit.
âI guess itâs just ironic that  he âs coming here â she said. âI guess things must have improved.â
 Trump  plans to be among 72 000 attending the College Football Playoff Championship game Monday evening between Georgia and Alabama. The game is being held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium  the new $1.5 billion home field of the Atlanta Falcons.
The stadium sits in the heart of downtown Atlanta  a place  Trump  targeted in a pair of tweets Jan. 14 last year. He was punching back at Democratic Rep. John Lewis. The Atlanta congressman  a civil rights hero  had said he would skip Trumpâs inauguration after allegations of Russian election meddling caused him to doubt  Trump  âas a legitimate president.â
 Trump  tweeted : âCongressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district  which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.â
Lewisâ 5th District seat covers most of the city of Atlanta  including downtown.  Trump âs attack galvanized residents to post photos of their neighborhoods and other Twitter rebuttals under the hashtag #defendthe5th.
âFor him to disparage someone like John Lewis is absolutely ludicrous â said Calvin  who figures  Trump  wants to come to the big game for the attention rather than any real interest in football.
Though Atlanta leans Democratic  both Georgia and Alabama are solid âTrump Countryâ states that strongly backed the president in the 2016 election. In a political sense  at least  thereâs no clear favorite for the New Yorker-in-chief to root for at the game.
Hawk said he had heard some snarky remarks from some neighbors about the presidentâs impending visit. But he doesnât expect  Trump  to receive an ungracious welcome.
It will be  Trump âs second trip to Atlanta since  his  disparaging remarks. Last April   he  addressed the National Rifle Associationâs annual convention  which was held in downtown Atlanta a short distance from the football stadium. Lewis spoke at a rally near the convention during  Trumpâs  visit  calling for stricter gun control measures.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms  serving her first week in office  declined through a spokeswoman to revisit  Trump âs year-old tweets.
âDr. King called on us to âmaintain the capacity to forgive â so it is in that spirit we encourage  Donald Trump  to extend  his  stay in Atlanta â said Michael Smith  the Georgia Democratsâ spokesman  who suggested the president take time to visit sites dedicated to Atlantaâs role in the civil rights movement.
Langer said she doubts  Trump  will see much of Atlanta as heâs whisked from the airport to the stadium and back  likely snarling the cityâs already notorious traffic. But she figures heâll enjoy himself at the game.","ATLANTA (AP) â When   [TGT] swoops into Atlanta for a VIP seat at college footballâs biggest game    [TGT]  âll enjoy the Southern hospitality of a city   [TGT]   disparaged a year ago as âfalling apartâ and âcrime infested.â

5198,Trump says East Coast could use 'Global Warming' during cold,Trump,"President Donald Trump  said Thursday the East Coast ""could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming"" as bitterly cold temperatures are expected to freeze large swaths of the country this holiday weekend.
 Trump  wrote on Twitter  ""In the East  it could be the COLDEST New Year's Eve on record.""  He  added: ""Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country  but not other countries  was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!""
 The president  did not acknowledge the difference between the weather and the climate. Weather refers to the atmospheric conditions during a shorter period  while climate is a longer view of weather patterns.
 Trump  has repeatedly expressed skepticism about climate change science  calling global warming a ""hoax"" created by the Chinese to damage American industry.
 He  announced earlier this year  his  intention to pull out of the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at curbing greenhouse gas production. The accord set goals for slowing the rate of climate change by reducing the emissions that contribute to melting Arctic ice  increasing sea levels and changing weather patterns across the globe.
Last year set a record for Earth's average global temperature. In an impromptu interview with The New York Times Thursday at his golf club in West Palm Beach  Florida   Trump  said  he  thinks special counsel Robert Mueller is ""going to be fair"" with respect to Mueller's investigation of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election last year and alleged ties between  Trump  campaign associates and Russia.
 He  said that ""everybody knows""  his  people did not collude with Russians  insisting in the interview that the ""real stories"" involve Democrats and their relationship with Russians during the campaign.  Trump  also told the Times  he  wasn't worried about the uncertainty concerning when the Mueller investigation might be concluded.

5199,DACA negotiations hit a snag ahead of White House meeting,Donald Trump,"(CNN) Republicans and Democrats will sit down with President Donald Trump in a bipartisan meeting Tuesday aimed at moving closer to protecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants from deportation  but a long-entrenched partisan divide over immigration policy and a looming budget deadline are threatening progress.
On Capitol Hill  bipartisan talks have been ongoing for months and the group of senators led by Durbin and Graham acknowledge they need  Trump  to lay out clear priorities to move forward.
The thinking is that  Trump  -- who secured the Republican Party's nomination by promising mass deportations and a border wall -- can offer political cover for Republicans who may be fearful of backing any immigration bill that is viewed as amnesty among their base. With  Trump 's blessing  Republicans believe they can find a way to move ahead on DACA. Without it  the votes are compromised.
The bipartisan meeting at the White House on Tuesday comes after  Trump  met with Republicans last week at the White House and Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona refused to attend  citing the lack of bipartisanship.","(CNN) Republicans and Democrats will sit down with  [TGT]  in a bipartisan meeting Tuesday aimed at moving closer to protecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants from deportation  but a long-entrenched partisan divide over immigration policy and a looming budget deadline are threatening progress.

5200,Playing McClellan to Trump 's Grant: The NeverTrump Traitors,Donald Trump,"Some learned and accomplished folks  who deservedly command a great deal of respect and admiration  view the  Trump  presidency in an entirely different light from what millions of Americans see.
I believe that those harboring an anti-Trump mindset would do well to consider that the election of  Trump  was never about the man â it was not the ""cult of personality"" that the major media and the establishment Republicans portrayed it to be  but rather more like an Arthurian drawing of sword from stone.
 Trump  wisely shouldered the long ignored mantle of champion for those of us who have grown intensely sick of the miasma of molestation surrounding our present citizen-government relationship.
If not for the insurgent candidacy of Ronald Reagan (who upended his presidential race in much the same way as  Trump ) we would have seen an unbroken line of feckless leadership for nearly a century.
You see  it isn't about  Trump  for those who support  him ; it's about America and the dire need to first preserve what liberties remain  then to fire back at the enemy until we have reversed the momentum; retaken lost territory; and restored the primacy of the people over their government â a primacy that is the hallmark of our nation  and our most valuable gift to posterity.
 Trump  will do this  indeed has been doing it  chalking up momentous ""wins"" for the cause of constitutionally limited government against the lurching  intrusive leviathan government built by more than a century of corrupt and rent-seeking ""representatives"" of both parties.
An article published recently by a prominent NeverTrump claimed credit for a momentous year of accomplishments on behalf of the Republican Party yet failed to admit the glaring truth â not a one of these achievements would have happened absent  Trump 's impetus  drive  and pugnacious style.
The question must be asked and answered by  Trump 's internecine detractors: ""who else would have done as much as  Trump ?""
Jeb Bush? Marco Rubio? Not even the most politically conservative candidate of the 2016 cycle  Ted Cruz  would have been so bold and unwaveringly determined as has been Donald Trump.
There is a cult of personality surrounding  Trump   that much is true  but it isn't among his supporters. It's among his detractors  both left and right  who are so obsessed with the man that they cannot see the outcome of the war through the smoke of the battle.
After all  the mantle  Trump  now wears has been there for the taking  if only these same ""conservative"" Republican ""leaders"" had been courageous enough to do so.","Some learned and accomplished folks  who deservedly command a great deal of respect and admiration  view the  Trump  presidency in an entirely different light from what millions of Americans see.

5201,Time at Mar,Donald Trump,"When  President Donald Trump  sat down with a reporter for a wide-ranging  30-minute interview at his private golf club here Thursday  not a single aide or adviser was present at the table - and not a single aide or adviser knew about it in advance.
The interview was enabled by Christopher Ruddy - a club member with a level of personal access to the president in Florida that rankles White House staff. He invited New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt as his personal guest to lunch at Trump International Golf Club  strategically ensured they were seated near  Trump 's regular table and brought the reporter over to meet the president  who was still in his golf clothes.
As word trickled back to the White House  advisers worked to reach the president  with  Trump 's personal aide interrupting at one point to hand him a cellphone with White House communicators director Hope Hicks on the line  who checked in on the interview from afar.
Mar-a-Lago - Trump's manicured  gilded oceanfront retreat here - is the president's ""Winter White House "" the villa to which he escapes for rounds of golf and family time. But  to the chagrin of many aides  Mar-a-Lago is also the place where  Trump  is often  his  most unrestrained and unfettered  making it harder for  his  West Wing staff to control  his  daily media diet and personal contacts as they now try to do in Washington.
Inside the White House  aides filter what information gets to  Trump  and who meets with  him   trying to prevent rash or uninformed decisions. They often monitor  his  call logs  with Chief of Staff John Kelly  who often listens in on calls  telling people to go through  him  when they want to speak to the president.
White House officials said they appreciate that time at Mar-a-Lago is a respite for  Trump   a familiar and comfortable haven for  him  to recharge while surrounded by family and friends. The president often gets less riled up by the sorts of stray comments on cable news that  back in Washington  might prompt an angry tweet or rejoinder  one added. Mar-a-Lago is not necessarily a panacea for angry tweets -  Trump  has fired off a few agitated messages since arriving in Florida.
All presidents have worked to escape the constraining bubble of Washington. When former president Barack Obama  near the end of his presidency  occasionally slipped the gates of the White House  he would joke that ""the bear is loose."" Yet by that metaphor  Mar-a-Lago has become a veritable ursine playground  with  Trump  starring in the role of chief grizzly - calling outside advisers and confidants  while playing both host and inquisitor to his wealthy members.
Mar-a-Lago  said Roger Stone  a former  Trump  campaign adviser and longtime friend of the president  ""allows  Trump  to be  Trump .""
""Nobody tells  Donald Trump  where  he  can and cannot go "" Stone said. ""The president is able to get a lot of information that is normally blocked from getting to him ... You don't have the minders. There is no doubt that he makes more calls.""
Instead   Trump  now sets up ""a virtual rope line "" said Ruddy â the chief executive of Newsmax  a conservative media company â where friends like he  Marvel chairman Ike Perlmutter and local restaurant owner Lee Lipton come to say hello.
 Trump   for instance  recently chatted with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman for 30 minutes after dining with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump  according to people familiar with the meeting.
Since becoming president  members' access to  Trump  has tightened  said Shannon Donnelly  society editor of the Palm Beach Daily News. ""It is one of the places where he can relax a little bit  but not anybody can just go up and talk to him at Mar-a-Lago "" she said  before adding  ""Unless he sees you and motions for you to come over for him.""
 Trump  often asks guests about foreign affairs or legislative accomplishments and solicits what they think of certain aides or how the White House is doing. Earlier this year   Trump  probed members about the Paris climate accord and North Korea  one person familiar with his questions said. He has quizzed Mar-a-Lago guests  alternately  on the performance of former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer  his news coverage  their opinions of Congress and his rally performances  according to several advisers.","When   [TGT] sat down with a reporter for a wide-ranging  30-minute interview at his private golf club here Thursday  not a single aide or adviser was present at the table - and not a single aide or adviser knew about it in advance.

""Nobody tells  Donald Trump  where  he  can and cannot go "" Stone said. ""The president is able to get a lot of information that is normally blocked from getting to him ... You don't have the minders. There is no doubt that he makes more calls.""
Instead   Trump  now sets up ""a virtual rope line "" said Ruddy â the chief executive of Newsmax  a conservative media company â where friends like he  Marvel chairman Ike Perlmutter and local restaurant owner Lee Lipton come to say hello.
 Trump   for instance  recently chatted with Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman for 30 minutes after dining with son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka Trump  according to people familiar with the meeting.
Since becoming president  members' access to  Trump  has tightened  said Shannon Donnelly  society editor of the Palm Beach Daily News. ""It is one of the places where he can relax a little bit  but not anybody can just go up and talk to him at Mar-a-Lago "" she said  before adding  ""Unless he sees you and motions for you to come over for him.""
 Trump  often asks guests about foreign affairs or legislative accomplishments and solicits what they think of certain aides or how the White House is doing. Earlier this year   Trump  probed members about the Paris climate accord and North Korea  one person familiar with his questions said. He has quizzed Mar-a-Lago guests  alternately  on the performance of former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer  his news coverage  their opinions of Congress and his rally performances  according to several advisers.",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,,,

Referring to reports that  the president  divulged classified information to Russian officials and that the leaked information came from Israeli sources  Perez said in a statement from the DNC that the Republican presidentâs actions âdirectly jeopardize our relationship with Israel and pose a security threat to our national security and risk lives  including those of our troops abroad.
Perez cited Trumpâs tweets Tuesday morning in which  the president  admitted that  he  shared with Russian officials âfactsâ related to the international fight against the Islamic State.
âAs  President  I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do  facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons  plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism â  Trump  tweeted.

5203,Weâre Obsessed With Donald Trump. Thatâs Not a Bad Thing.,Donald Trump,"By the time The Donald set foot on that escalator  our world of news was already devolving into a set of 24/7 zombie-apocalypse events. Otherwise  he and his rants  his red face and strange orange comb-over wouldnât have made much sense at all. He would have been an unimaginable candidate before the media went into crisis  experienced what might be thought of as its own news inequality gap  and began refocusing on a few singular events of particularly resonant horror. These  in turn  regularly wiped away most of the rest of what was actually happening on this planet  while giving media units with smaller staffs and fewer resources the opportunity to put all their attention and energy into a set of eye-gluing  funds- and staff-preserving spectacles. As CBS Chairman Les Moonves put it bluntly during the 2016 presidential campaign  speaking of the focus on Trumpâs candidacy and antics  âIt may not be good for America  but itâs damn good for CBS.â¦ Iâve never seen anything like this  and this is going to be a very good year for us. Sorry. Itâs a terrible thing to say. But  bring it on   Donald . Keep going.â
It was  in other words  the perfect moment for a billionaire salesman-cum-conman-cum-reality-TV-sensation to descend that escalator.  Donald Trump  was neither a media mistake  nor an out-of-space-and-time experience.  He  was a man made for our unfounding media moment.
And this same way of thinking about  him  is applicable to so much else. As our unfounding father   he âs inconceivable without an American world that was already experiencing various kinds of incipient unfounding.
Whatever  he  might now be fathering   he  himself was the child  for instance  of a distinctly plutocratic moment. If we have our first billionaire in the White House  itâs only because by 2015 this countryâs democratic politics had devolved (with a little helping hand from the Supreme Court) into a set of 1 percent  or perhaps even .01 percent  elections.
Similarly  if this country hadnât been pursuing its never-ending war on terror so assiduously and unsuccessfully these last 16 years  while Washington was being transformed into a war capital  the national-security state was rising to prominence as a kind of shadow government  and the funding of the US military hadnât become the only truly bipartisan issue in Congress  Trumpism would never have been conceivable. In our American world  The  Donald âs tendency toward authoritarianism is often treated as if it were a unique attribute of  his . To believe that  however  you would have to overlook the growth in this century of a distinctly authoritarian spirit in Washington. You would have to ignore what it meant for the national-security state to be ever more embedded in our ruling city. You would have to forget about the American intelligence communityâs development of an historically unprecedented surveillance machinery aimed not just at the world but at American citizens as well.
The  Donald âs surprising decision to surround  himself  with âmy generalsâ in a fashion never before seen in Washington  even in wartime  was treated in a similarly anomalous fashion. And yet  given the Washington  he  entered  it was anything but. During the election campaign  candidate  Trump  referred to those same generals as ârubble â while deriding the losing wars they had been fighting for so long.  He  seemed in some way to grasp that this was a country and a citizenry increasingly being unmade by war.
Still  it took  him  next to no time as president to tack to where Washington had been heading since 9/11. As Iâve argued elsewhere   he  might better be thought of as our chameleon president: a Democrat who became a fervent Republican  a billionaire businessman who somehow convinced rural white-working class voters that  he  was their man  a former globalizer whoâs taken off like a bat out of hell after globalizing trade pacts of every sort.

5205,Their Refusal To Tolerate Is Creating Global Backlash On LGBT People,Obama,"This return to pragmatism breaks with the Obama yearsâ rigid ideological dogmatism about human rights and clearly rattled the bureaucrats who leaked the memo. But his arguments cannot be easily shoved aside. Promoting a rigid leftist agenda internationally is a form of social engineering.
The Human Rights Campaign is enraged that Egypt may enact a law that punishes waving the rainbow flag or otherwise promoting LGBT behavior. Yet Egypt is just the latest example in a global streak of laws and enforcement actions to chastise sodomy  homosexual lewdness  and LGBT advocacy  as the Washington Post reported last fall. African countries  Russia and ex-Soviet nations  as well as Indonesia  Malaysia  Bangladesh  and other Asian nations with significant Muslim populations  have all responded to increased pressure about LGBT policies during the  Obama  administration with punitive laws  policies to protect children from homosexual propaganda  and even police crackdowns on LGBT establishments and social circles.
Although socially traditional  most of the countries where the backlash is hardest were never hotbeds of anti-gay sentiment  or especially dangerous for individuals who led an LGBT double life. They became so as a result of the relentless international pressure on LGBT issues from the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration  United Nations (UN) bureaucrats  the European Union  huge corporations  and LGBT groups backed by billionaires and western governments.
Under Obamaâs presidency  LGBT policies seemed to became the highest priority of the U.S. State Department. We have pressured countries to stop opposing LGBT policies at the United Nations. We have boasted of twisting diplomatsâ arms to get them to back off defending their laws and social norms  sacrificing other U.S. foreign policy priorities and further widening the democratic deficit at the UN.
Most egregiously  during the Obama years the United States asked repeatedly to scrap the part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights about the family as ânatural and fundamental group unit of societyâ in U.N. documents. The reason is simple. Under this standard  international law does not recognize homosexual relations as capable of constituting a family.
Although LGBT advocacy has lessened under the Trump administration  the United States has yet to officially change position on most of these matters. Those pushing this agenda are deeply embedded in the U.S. State Department and still carrying the momentum of the Obama years  dictating many U.S. positions in international negotiations.
During the Obama administration  especially in the final two years  LGBT issues became more public and politically divisive at the United Nations and in capitals around the world. Delegates routinely complained about the relentless LGBT pressure from  the Obama administration .
Already  the issue has polarized the UN system like never before. Last year  the Human Rights Council established the first UN post with a mandate to address violence and discrimination on âsexual orientation and gender identity.â That mandate was contested all the way to a very close vote in the General Assembly  despite an herculean effort of  the Obama administration  to get countries to not show up to vote according to their own laws.

Speaking Saturday about Flynn's plea deal   the president  reiterated that there had been no coordination between  his  campaign and Russia. ""What has been shown is no collusion  no collusion "" Trump said  ""There's been absolutely no collusion  so we're very happy.""
Despite  his  assertions throughout this year that there was no wrongdoing by  himself  or anyone associated with  his  campaign  Trump has been critical of Mueller's probe and the FBI generally.

5209,The Latest: House OKs foreign surveillance program,Donald Trump,"The U.S. intelligence services are enacting a mandate from  President Donald Trump  to establish guidelines on ""unmasking"" the identities of U.S. citizens in intelligence reports.
The measure aims to more tightly restrict how the names of Americans kept secret in intelligence reports can be revealed  particularly during presidential transitions. The move follows unsubstantiated charges by  President Donald Trump  that  his  predecessor's administration spied on  his  campaign and improperly ""unmasked"" the identities of  his  associates during the 2016 presidential campaign and transition.
 President Donald Trump  is suggesting that a key program to collect foreign intelligence could have been used to ""badly surveil and abuse""  his  campaign.

5210,U.S. foreign officials warn Trump not to call Jerusalem Israel's capital,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The possibility that U.S. President Donald Trump may recognize Jerusalem as Israelâs capital has stirred opposition from U.S. and foreign officials who fear it could unleash violence.
If  Trump  made such a move  it could spark demonstrations or violence by Palestinians or by Muslims around the world  in part because of the sensitivity of the Jerusalem site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif.
A senior U.S. official told Reuters last week that  Trump  was likely to make the announcement on Jerusalemâs being Israelâs capital on Wednesday  though  his  adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner on Sunday said no final decision had been made.
The White House said it would not take any action on Monday on whether to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv  something that  Trump  had promised to do in his presidential campaign.
 Trump  is expected to sign the waiver  according to several U.S. officials. One U.S. official said  Trump  was likely to accompany the signing with an order for his aides to begin serious planning for an eventual embassy move  though it was unclear whether he would establish a strict timetable.

Wray's formal opposition to the release of a secret partisan memo  supported by Republicans critical of the bureau  also sets the stage for a showdown over the future of the nation's most revered law enforcement agency which  before  Trump   enjoyed longstanding support from the GOP.
 Only Trump  could separate the law-and-order party  as the Republicans have been known as for decades  from the FBI. He has done this as part of his larger effort to delegitimize all who have participated in various probes of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and other violations of criminal and civil law they might uncover.

Nunes entered this episode with a reputation tarnished by a misadventure that found  him  racing to the White House last March  in the dead of night  to supposedly ""confirm what I already knew"" about the supposed ""wiretapping"" of  Trump 's phone by the previous administration. This harebrained notion was disproved and Nunes suddenly stepped away from leading his committee's Russian work. Now he's back  with his four-page memo  which he apparently signed without actually reading the underlying material himself.
But for his efforts to aid  Trump 's campaign against the investigation of the Russia controversy  few Americans would know the name Devin Nunes. Now he's known as the main congressional enabler of the President push-back campaign. He has been diminished by this alliance  as so many are when they go near  Trump .
As a uniquely disruptive political figure   Trump  has resisted fully acknowledging the seriousness of the Russian election meddling and subsequent evidence that  his  associates -- notably  his  son Donald Jr.  former national security adviser Michael Flynn  and attorney general Jeff Sessions -- met and may have aided Russian agents. He abruptly fired Wray's predecessor  former FBI Director James Comey.
At the center of the conflict stand the wildly unreliable and erratic  Trump  and special counsel Mueller  a Republican who enjoys esteem across the political spectrum. With the arrest of former  Trump  campaign operatives Paul Manafort and George Papadopoulos  Mueller signaled the seriousness of his endeavor.  Trump   who has long fumed angrily over the investigation and scandal  has responded by stepping up his campaign of denigration and disruption.
As The New York Times reported January 25   Trump  actually ordered the firing of Mueller   offering thinly constructed complaints about supposed conflicts of interest  only to back off of the demand when  his  White House counsel threatened to resign.
Days later came a report that  Trump  is talking privately about the notion that the Justice Department could somehow turn the tables and prosecute Mueller . According to Howard Fineman of NBC News  a  Trump  adviser said  ""Here's how it would work: 'We're sorry  Mr. Mueller  you won't be able to run the federal grand jury today because he has to go testify to another federal grand jury.'""
Here it's helpful to consider that  Donald Trump  came of age during the Nixon years  when the president proved unable to shut down an FBI investigation of the Watergate break-in and ultimately resigned over the attempted coverup. And our current President was tutored in the political arts by Nixon loyalist Roger Stone   who  like others  believe Nixon shouldn't have been impeached. (Stone has said that John Dean  the Watergate whistleblower  ""perpetrated a fraud"" against Nixon.)

5213,Trump administration planning to cap refugees at 45 000 for next fiscal year,Trump,"The Trump administration  has confirmed that the U.S. plans to set a limit of 45 000 refugees for the next fiscal year -â a drop from  Trump âs 50 000 cap last year and the 110 000 that Obama pledged the U.S. would take in during his final months in office.
 The administration  plans to admit 19 000 refugees from Africa; 5 000 from East Asia; 2 000 from Europe and Central Asia; 1 500 from Latin America and the Caribbean; and 17 500 from Near East and South Asia  according to an administration plan sent to Congress.
âWe want to make sure that this is a secure process and that no one is allowed through that might endanger the security of America â one official told reporters  pointing to new vetting procedures  the administration  has already implemented as well as future ones that are being considered under an ongoing 120-day review that ends Oct. 24.
The new vetting procedures could mean longer processing times for refugees  and between this and the asylum-seeker backlog   the administration  will not be able to process as many people  according to the officials. After the 120-day review of the vetting procedures   the administration  will announce what changes will be implemented  but some additional procedures have been added already.
But officials did not explain why they needed to lower the cap if the screening procedures are already being strengthened and if the new procedures wonât necessarily take longer. They also said they donât know yet whether refugees from the countries on Trumpâs latest travel ban will be allowed to apply â- something to be determined by the 120-day review.
But a U.S. official âunequivocallyâ denied that  the Trump administration  wants to slow walk admissions in an effort to lower refugee totals even more  promising  âWe have every plan to process as many refugees as we can under this ceiling.â
Despite the 110 000 cap Obama proposed  the U.S. will have admitted only 54 000 this fiscal year  which ends Saturday -- after  Trump  initially banned refugee admissions for 120 days  then set a new 50 000 cap.
That's a point that Sen. Ben Cardin  the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  expressed concern about  asking in a statement  âHow can we credibly ask them to continue accepting refugees if we refuse to do our part?â Cardin  a top critic of  Trump 's foreign policy  also blasted âthe administrationâs indifference and lack of humanity.â
A State Department official says that since 1980  the president makes the final determination after the administration consults with Congress  meaning âthereâs always a chance it could changeâ and  Trump  could decrease or increase the number on  his  own.
There is precedent for that too. Last year  the Obama administration originally proposed a 100 000 ceiling during consultations  later changing it to 110 000. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was on Capitol Hill Wednesday evening to consult the Senate and House Judiciary Committees  so  Trump âs decision must wait until after that.","[TGT] has confirmed that the U.S. plans to set a limit of 45 000 refugees for the next fiscal year -â a drop from  Trump âs 50 000 cap last year and the 110 000 that Obama pledged the U.S. would take in during his final months in office.

5214,House Backs Warrantless,Donald Trump,"The House voted Thursday to extend the governmentâs authority to spy on foreignersâ digital communications  hours after  President Donald Trump  sowed confusion over the bill by sending a tweet that resurrected  his  prior claims that  his  campaign team had been spied upon.
It was unclear whether  Trump  impulsively intended to try to derail the bill  which is supported by  his  administration and congressional allies. Soon after   he  posted another tweet endorsing passage. Between the two tweets   he  phoned House Speaker Paul Ryan to talk about the FISA bill  according to a Republican aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The  Trump  administration and the intelligence community want to preserve the program as-is.
Initially on Thursday  after similar sentiments were voiced by a commentator on âFox and Friends â the presidentâs favorite cable morning show   Trump  wrote: ââHouse votes on controversial FISA ACT today.â This is the act that may have been used  with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier  to so badly surveil and abuse the  Trump  Campaign by the previous administration and others?â
But later   Trump  seemed to reverse course: âWith that being said  I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and todayâs vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!â
 Trumpâs  second tweet referred to claims by some congressional Republicans that Obama administration officials may have improperly âunmaskedâ the names of Americans -- perhaps including some of  Trumpâs  own associates -- whose conversations or names were incidentally picked up in foreign surveillance.
âBy the way  somebody should tell the president. He thinks it is in the bill â she said  referring to  Trump âs initial tweet.
Ryan said at a news conference later Thursday that he speaks with  Trump  almost daily. He said the president has concerns about domestic provisions of the FISA law  which werenât involved in the bill passed Thursday. ""He knows that and I think he put out something that clarifies that "" Ryan said.
 Trump âs own cybersecurity chief vouched for the law Thursday at an FBI cybersecurity conference in New York.
Obama administration officials have described the requests to unmask some Americansâ identities as routine efforts to understand the travel and actions of foreign officials.  Trump  allies have argued the unmasking incidents validate the presidentâs unsubstantiated claim that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential transition.","The House voted Thursday to extend the governmentâs authority to spy on foreignersâ digital communications  hours after   [TGT] sowed confusion over the bill by sending a tweet that resurrected  his  prior claims that  his  campaign team had been spied upon.

5215,Immigration and business schools: The Trump effect,Trump,"UNLIKE many of Americaâs prominent business executives   Donald Trump  gained  his  acumen on the streets of New York rather than in an MBA classroom (though  he  did attend an undergraduate programme at Wharton). But two recent surveys suggest that  Mr Trump  is having an effect on Americaâs business schools nonetheless.
The  Trump  administration plans to tighten the rules around H-1B visasâwhich are awarded to foreigners looking to work in the United Statesâfollowing up on a campaign pledge to support âAmerica firstâ. This financial year 65 000 such visas will handed out (plus 20 000 specifically for people who hold a Master's degree). But last year more than 230 000 people applied  and quotas were filled within days.
The MBACSEAâs findings support those of an earlier survey  carried out by the Graduate Management Admissions Council (GMAC)  the body which administers the GMAT test. GMAC asked applicants to business schools whether the outcome of the presidential election had swayed their decision to pursue a graduate business degree at an American business school. Overall  37% said  Mr Trump's  election made them less likely to apply; more than half of applicants with a GMAT score higher than 700 said they had been dissuaded.
The findings are bad news for American employers and business school alike. The MBA is a global phenomenon; students can now choose between high-quality schools on nearly every continent. And anything that dissuades foreigners will affect the quality of the education. The benefits of diverse classrooms are well established: students learn business practices from different perspectives  and become more rounded candidates simply by spending time with a varied cohort.

âStatement by me last night in Florida: âHonestly  I donât think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA  but they donât want to help..We are ready  willing and able to make a deal but they donât want to â  he  posted on Monday  reiterating comments  he  made Sunday at  his  Florida golf resort.
ââThey donât want security at the border  they donât want to stop drugs  they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do  â â  Trump  continued. âMy standard is very simple  AMERICA FIRST & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! â
 Trump  on Sunday wrote in a tweet that the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is âprobably deadâ because Democrats arenât fully involved.
 Trump  last September rescinded the 2012 program that shields from deportation young immigrants brought to the US illegally  and called on Congress to make some legislative changes before it expires on March 5.
An immigration deal worked out by a bipartisan group of senators was rejected during a White House meeting last Thursday during which  Trump  reportedly questioned why the US was taking immigrants from âsâthole countriesâ like Africa  Haiti and El Salvador.
 He  denied making the comment and defended  himself  from accusations of racism when  he  spoke to reporters outside  his  Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday evening.

5217,The 10 Events You Need To Know To Understand The Almost,Trump,"President Trump 's reported order last summer to fire Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is all about obstruction of justice â whether it happened  and whether it could be proved.
 Trump  ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller in June  as The New York Times reported on Thursday. McGahn refused  and threatened to quit.  Trump  backed off.
Speaking to reporters Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland   Trump  dismissed the report. ""Fake news. Fake news "" the president said in brief remarks as he entered the conference hall. ""Typical New York Times. Fake stories.""
And prior to leaving for Davos  the president had told reporters he was willing to talk to Mueller's investigators under oath.  Trump  said  he  was ""looking forward to it."" At the time  the president also said  ""There's been no collusion whatsoever. There's no obstruction whatsoever.""
Still  because of the events of the past year  ""it now appears likely that Mueller will conclude that  Trump  obstructed justice "" wrote former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti on Friday. Here's the chain of events that led to now:
Four days later  and after a second meeting between McGahn and Yates  Trump fires Yates. The reason given by the White House is her decision to instruct Justice Department attorneys not to defend his immigration restrictions. But subsequent events raise the question about whether Yates' dismissal also was connected to the unwelcome visit she paid to McGahn.
Either way  McGahn told  Trump  that Flynn had probably provided an inaccurate portrayal of events to FBI investigators  according to  Trump  lawyer John Dowd.
3. Comey says  Trump  asks for loyalty;  Trump  fires Flynn
On Jan. 27   President Trump  arranges a dinner with then-FBI Director James Comey  where  according to Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee   the president  says: ""I need loyalty  I expect loyalty.""
Comey said he felt like the dinner was an effort on the part of  the president  to have him ask for his job and ""create some sort of patronage relationship.""
 Trump  has denied asking Comey for a loyalty pledge.
Meanwhile  the spin cycle continues to churn about Flynn's discussions with Kislyak  accounts of which were leaked to the Washington Post. About two weeks later  on Feb. 13   Trump  fires Flynn.
The very next day  according to Comey  he visited the Oval Office for a meeting with  Trump  and advisers. Afterward   the president  cleared the room of everyone except him and the FBI director.
""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go  to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go "" Comey says  Trump  said.
 Trump  has continually denied that he ever asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn.

5220,The Democrat Trump should fear in 2020 â and it âs not Oprah,Trump,"More than half of Americans are uninterested in keeping  President Trump  around for a second term  according to a new poll. But to be fair  considering  his  historically low approval ratings  this is not that surprising.
A recent Quinnipiac poll says that more Americans would vote for former vice president Joe Biden than  Trump . It certainly wouldn't be a landslide win: 48 percent of respondents said they'd pick Biden  while 44 percent said they'd elect the president for a second term.
Biden has not ruled out running in 2020  after opting not to enter the race in 2016  citing the death of his son Beau Biden and a need to focus on family. But  if elected  Biden would be 78 years old when entering the White House.  The former vice president  ranks at No. 2 behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on The Fix's list of top 2020 contenders.
And speaking of the #MeToo movement  the buzz around Oprah Winfrey after her campaign-style speech during the Golden Globes  confirmed that she would beat  the president . According to the poll  she would get 52 percent of the vote to Trump's 39 percent. But 66 percent of respondents said electing a celebrity as president is a bad idea.
One particular lawmaker who is considered a front-runner by many liberals would not appear to have the support needed to beat  Trump : Sanders. When asked whether theyâd be inclined to vote for Sanders over  Trump   55 percent of those surveyed said no.
It has become a common argument on the left when lamenting  Trump  that had Sanders been the Democratic nominee over Hillary Clinton  he would have attracted enough support to beat  Trump . The argument is that liberals who did not back Clinton would have voted for Sanders  along with some of the white working-class voters and men who ultimately chose  Trump .
The survey did not poll Americans on other hypothetical 2020 candidates  including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). But what is clear is that more than half of Americans seem uninterested in allowing  Trump  to remain in the White House for another term.
In a question in which no opponent is named  62 percent of respondents said that they would not be inclined to vote for  Trump ; 34 percent said they would.
â President Donald Trump  canât seem to improve  his  approval rating  perhaps because of the troubling fact that half of the voters we spoke to think  he  is mentally unstable â said Tim Malloy  assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. â The president  is a divider  not a uniter  say an overwhelming number of voters  an assessment made even more disturbing by  his  perceived lack of respect for people of color.â","More than half of Americans are uninterested in keeping   [TGT] around for a second term  according to a new poll.

While itâs been a bumpy ride for  the Trump administration   lurching from one controversy to another   it  ended with a big tax cut victory in Congress that could help Republicans survive the challenging 2018 midterm elections.
 The U.S. economy  is finally soaring as a result of the tax rate reductions  breaking out of the anemic 2 percent growth rates of the Obama years that prevented America from achieving its fullest economic potential.

5222,The Very Best Liar: Nearly a Year In Trump Averages 5.6 Untrue Statements Per Day,Donald Trump,"""All governments lie "" as the saying goes  but  Donald Trump  appears to have taken presidential lying to new heights during just  his  first year in the White House.
According to an ongoing analysis by the Washington Post that has tracked  Trump 's formal speeches  Twitter tirades  and impromptu remarks to the press  the president made 1 950 false or misleading statements during his first 347 days in office. On average  the president says something that is untrue 5.6 times per day.
With just over two weeks left before he reaches the one-year mark   Trump  is on track to surpass 2 000 lies  misleading the public at a far higher rate than  his  recent predecessors.
As the Post's database demonstrates   Trump 's lies come in a variety of forms and pervade nearly every topic  he  discusses  from jobs and the stock market to immigration and foreign policy.
The database also makes clear that the president isn't sufficiently inventive to come up with new lies on a day-to-day basis. Rather   he  frequently rehashes old onesâ Trump  has repeated the claim that Obamacare is ""essentially"" dead over 50 times  for instance.  Trump  has also repeatedly insistedâcontradicting all available evidenceâthat the tax bill  he  signed into law last month will cost  him  ""a fortune.""
"" Trump  repeated the falsehood about having the biggest tax cut 53 times  even though Treasury Department data shows it would rank eighth "" the Post adds. ""And 58 times  Trump  has claimed that the United States pays the highest corporate taxes (25 times) or that it is one of the highest-taxed nations (33 times). The latter is false; the former is misleading  as the effective U.S. corporate tax rate (what companies end up paying after deductions and benefits) ends up being lower than the statutory tax rate.""
The problem  as many analysts have noted  is that  Trump 's prodigious lying has had little to no effect on his core base of support.
As The Atlantic's David Graham noted last year  hardcore supporters of the president are often unfazed by his false statements. Though  Trump  backers are frequently willing to admit when the president says something that is untrue  their support for him rarely wavers because of his misleading claims.
In a column for the Philadelphia Daily News on Monday  Will Bunch warned that  Trump 's base of support combined with  his  ability to manipulate the media raises the ""scary"" possibilityâdespite polls showing  he  is the least popular first-year president in American historyâthat  he  could still win reelection in 2020.

Read on for a list of  Trump 's most iconic nicknames.
 Dicky Durbin
Trump  made waves this week for calling Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin  D-Ill.  âDicky Durbinâ on Twitter.
â Senator Dicky Durbin  totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting â  Trump  tweeted Monday. ""Deals canât get made when there is no trust!  Durbin  blew DACA and is hurting our Military.â
 Durbin  claimed Friday that  Trump  âsaid things that were hate-filled  vile  and racistâ at a bilateral meeting on immigration Thursday.  The president  reportedly spoke of âs---hole countriesâ at the meeting.

5225,Twitter just explained why it won't block Trump for tweets that North Korea considers a declaration of war,Donald Trump,"Donald Trump's tweets  have long raised questions about whether  they  violate Twitter's rules prohibiting abusive behavior on the service.
On Monday  after a  Trump  tweet threatened that North Korea might not ""be around much longer "" Twitter was forced to explain why the President was not banned from the service.
 Trump 's tweet came at time of heightened tensions between the US and North Korea  following several North Korean missile launches and nuclear tests that have drawn sharp criticism from the international community. On Friday a North Korean official said the country might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.
 Trump  and North Korean government have been engaged in a war of words  with North Korea's foreign minister calling  Trump  ""mentally deranged"" and  Trump  referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as ""Rocket Man.""
After  Trump 's tweet on Saturday  North Korea's foreign minister told reporters that the country considers  Trump 's tweet to be a declaration of war  and that his country can thus legally shoot down US military planes  according to NPR.
Special  Trump  rules?
The episode has put Twitter in a difficult position  leading many observers to question how  the company 's policies against threats and abuse squared with tweets by  Trump  that some believe risk provoking a nuclear conflict.
Under  its  existing policy  Twitter reserves the right to remove content and disable accounts that post violent threats or harassment.
 The company  has left up  Trump 's tweet about North Korea because of  its  ""newsworthiness"" and ""public interest value"" â two factors which are taken into account for all content considered otherwise in violation of  the company 's content policy.
That explanation struck some critics as tantamount to Twitter admitting that the usual rules don't apply to  Trump .

5226,Trump Greeted Enthusiastically In Lake Charles Louisiana During Pit Stop,Donald Trump,"LAKE CHARLES  Louisiana â Hundreds of enthusiastic Louisianans waving American flags  Texas Lives Matter signs  and 2016 campaign lawn signs greeted  President Donald Trump  during  his  brief stop at the National Guard headquarters here Saturday.
 Trump âs 15 minute stop  during which  he  met members of the Cajun Navy rescue group  is the last stop on  his  tour of areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. Although Lake Charles didnât receive the brunt of Hurricane Harveyâs destruction  it has been a staging point for relief efforts in eastern Texas. And while there wasnât much in the way of disaster touring to be done in Lake Charles  the pit stop is sure to lift the spirits of a president with historic unpopularity.
Lake Charles is friendly territory for  Trump   who waved and smiled at the crowd outside the headquarters. âI think itâs great. Itâs a chance to see how much everybody here in Louisiana supports  him  â said Kim Strickell  a Lake Charles native who came to catch a glimpse of the president along with her family and friends. Strickell said she is pleased with how  Trump  has handled the aftermath of Harvey. â He âs put federal dollars out there ahead of it. Thatâs a big help â Strickell said. Her nephew  16-year-old Jack Slade  was also on hand. An ardent supporter of  Trump   Slade said âeven though I am a minor  I know my beliefs already.â Although the crowd was almost entirely made up of  Trump  supporters  there were also plenty of people simply on hand to witness a bit of history. âItâs historic â said Miles Brown  23. Asked if he was a  Trump  supporter  Brown hesitated. âIâm not going to say that exactly. But I hope for the best with this president. Because Iâm tired of seeing the same thing going on. This person did say he wanted change. I havenât seen it yet  but itâs better to support him than keep talking down on him.â

5227,Trump uses misleading $5.5 trillion tax cut figure to sell GOP law,Trump,"President Donald Trump  will talk up the tax law during a speech in Nashville on Monday.
In the speech   Trump  will tout ""a total of $5.5 TRILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS.""
 President Donald Trump  is headed to Nashville on Monday as part of an ongoing attempt to sell the recently passed Republican tax law. But one of the biggest selling points  he 's set to tout paints a misleading picture of the law's effects.
According to excerpts of the speech released prior to its delivery   Trump  plans to tout ""a total of $5.5 TRILLION DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS"" in the new law that will mostly help ""working families  small businesses and FAMILY FARMERS.""
But the massive cuts  Trump  cites only account for half the equation.
Adding in those parts of the law  like the cap on the state and local tax deduction  brings the total tax change to a little under $1.5 trillion â a little more than one-quarter of  Trump 's statistic.
Focusing on the gross tax cuts  instead of the overall effects  could be an attempt by  Trump  to sweeten the tax law for a public that has so far rejected the changes.","[TGT] will talk up the tax law during a speech in Nashville on Monday.

""This is the final question "" Stern said toward the end of a 2006 episode of ""The Howard Stern Show"" in which  Trump  appeared. ""Are you ready? You are the president of the United States. What do we do about North Korea?""
""I would be so tough  you have no idea  "" Trump  replied.

""You would â"" Stern began  before  Trump  interjected with ""Embargoes?""
""Embargoes?"" Stern repeated  presumably seeking to clarify  Trump 's statement.
""Well  I think I'd go beyond embargoes  "" Trump  said. ""I would be so tough  but I wouldn't send [then-Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice in to negotiate.""
Stern asked why  to which  Trump  replied  ""I don't think  she 's tough enough. I mean  I don't think  she 's a tough person.""
When Stern asked if Rice was  a ""lightweight "" Trump  said  he  thought  she  was ""not tough enough to do a good job.""
Eleven years later  North Korea is one of the  Trump  administration's most pressing threats  and  Trump  has responded to it with combative rhetoric.

5231,Michael Lewis: Many Trump Appointees Are Uninterested In The Agencies They Head Up : NPR,Donald Trump,"This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You might know our guest  journalist Michael Lewis  from some of his books  such as ""Moneyball"" and ""The Big Short "" both of which were adapted into movies. Lewis has spent a lot of this year exploring the ways the  Trump  administration is changing the federal government at the ground level.
Lewis has spoken to many career employees of the departments of energy and agriculture. He says they found  Trump  appointees ill-prepared for the jobs they have and uninterested in the work of the departments they're running. In a series of articles for Vanity Fair  Lewis reports that the consequences of such ill-informed leadership could be troubling in areas as critical as maintenance of the nation's nuclear arsenal and managing nuclear waste  both functions of the Energy Department. Lewis spoke to FRESH AIR's Dave Davies about his series and about his latest book  ""The Undoing Project "" which is now out in paperback.
MICHAEL LEWIS: Well  my mind when  Trump  was elected was on the subject of risk because I just finished a book  ""The Undoing Project "" about people's - the difficulty people had processing risk  in evaluating risk. And I was wondering what risks  Trump  brought with  him . I then saw that the transition from the Obama administration to the  Trump  administration basically didn't happen  (laughter) that - what normally happens after a new president comes in is that the day after the election  dozens of people roll into each of the agencies and start getting briefings from the people who are on their way out or from the career civil servants.
And then days passed  and they finally kind of get word that  well  they're a little disorganized  and nobody's coming. And it was actually the better part of two months before anybody shows up who's going to be - who's going to represent  Trump 's transition to the Department of Agriculture. So they had - they were just left waiting for a long time.
LEWIS: He's not the first person who's appointed by  Trump  to go in and be the transition person. But the first two people I think had problems because they were a lobbyist for  like  the soda industry. (Laughter) And there was protests about that person being involved in such an enterprise because  among other things  the USDA is responsible for the nation's nutrition and understanding it and promoting good nutrition. So the first guy who actually shows up and is still there is named Klippenstein  and he comes from an operation called Protect The Harvest.
LEWIS: That kind of - yes  dogfighting and circuses and  you know  poultry farming. And wherever animals might be mistreated  the USDA has some responsibility to monitor it. And anyway  so this guy - but he's a one-man transition team. And the thing that's bewildering to the people inside the USDA who thought they were going to be passing the baton and explaining to the  Trump  administration how the Department of Agriculture works is that they thought this is a job for 20 people to be done over 80 days  not one person over a couple of weeks. So the feeling generally inside the institution was that the transition never really happened  and the people who eventually come in never really got the briefings.
Essentially there was a witch hunt across the government for scientists  policy people who were responsible for responding to climate change because the position of the  Trump  administration was that basically it didn't exist. And so the career civil servant who was asked for the names of people in the Department of Agriculture who might be involved in  say  researching climate change refused to give up names. So that got shut down right away.
DAVIES: Eventually a larger team of  Trump  appointees did arrive at the Department of Agriculture. Who were they? What kind of backgrounds did they bring?
What concerned her was  first  who  Trump  had nominated to be her replacement - an Iowa right-wing talk show radio host named Sam Clovis  who had absolutely no background in science  whose chief qualification seems to have been he was just really loyal to  Trump . He was co-chairman of  Trump 's campaign. And she  like everybody else  was mystified because while you can understand why political loyalists need to find their homes inside of an administration  why put him in a place where you actually have to know something? You know  why put him in charge of the science end of the Department of Agriculture  especially since so much of that research that's being done is one way or another related to climate change? And he doesn't think climate change exists.
DAVIES: I want to come back to Sam Clovis  the guy that the  Trump  administration nominated as the chief scientist for the Department of Agriculture who you say didn't have a background in science  was a talk show host. What do we know about his effect on the science program in the Department of Agriculture so far?
So this is to me - there's a theme in the sort of risks that the  Trump  administration are taking by putting people who are not suited for jobs into the jobs. And one of the themes is that they're - a willingness to tax the distant future for the political present because the distant future really doesn't have a voice at the table.
DAVIES: My guest is Michael Lewis. His article is about the  Trump  administration's impact on departments of the federal government appear in Vanity Fair. Since our interview was recorded  the president's pick to be chief scientist of the Agriculture Department  Sam Clovis  has withdrawn his nomination. It was revealed that last year  Clovis was the  Trump  campaign supervisor of George Papadopoulos  who tried to broker a relationship between the campaign and Russian officials and has admitted lying about it to the FBI. We'll hear more of our interview with Michael Lewis after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Michael Lewis  the author of ""Moneyball"" and other books. His latest is ""The Undoing Project."" He has some articles now in Vanity Fair about how the  Trump  administration is reshaping the work of several federal departments  among them the Departments of Agriculture and the Department of Energy. I want to talk about the energy department. The energy department had reams of briefing material ready for the  Trump  team when they arrived. Who showed up  if anyone?
LEWIS: Nobody showed up the day after the election. They - and they were  too - were expecting 20 to 30 people roll in. And they were especially alarmed because like the Department of Agriculture  the energy department is misnamed. It really is misleading. You think it's about energy. It's really more about nuclear weapons. It's where the nuclear stockpile is maintained. And because they're in the middle of national security issues - and they were terrified that the  Trump  administration was not going to know what it needed to know.
It'd be like  how do we maintain the nuclear stockpile  or  what's going on with a nuclear cleanup in Eastern Washington - very technical things. And I would also give you guidance on how the place runs. But the  Trump  administration took - clearly took the view that they had nothing to learn at all from the people who had been running the place for the last eight years.
DAVIES: You write that there was - what was called as a beachhead team  some group of  Trump  staffers who showed up. What did you hear that they did?","This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.

He says they found   [TGT]   appointees ill-prepared for the jobs they have and uninterested in the work of the departments they're running. In a series of articles for Vanity Fair  Lewis reports that the consequences of such ill-informed leadership could be troubling in areas as critical as maintenance of the nation's nuclear arsenal and managing nuclear waste  both functions of the Energy Department. Lewis spoke to FRESH AIR's Dave Davies about his series and about his latest book  ""The Undoing Project "" which is now out in paperback.
MICHAEL LEWIS: Well  my mind when  Trump  was elected was on the subject of risk because I just finished a book  ""The Undoing Project "" about people's - the difficulty people had processing risk  in evaluating risk. And I was wondering what risks  Trump  brought with  him . I then saw that the transition from the Obama administration to the  Trump  administration basically didn't happen  (laughter) that - what normally happens after a new president comes in is that the day after the election  dozens of people roll into each of the agencies and start getting briefings from the people who are on their way out or from the career civil servants.
And then days passed  and they finally kind of get word that  well  they're a little disorganized  and nobody's coming. And it was actually the better part of two months before anybody shows up who's going to be - who's going to represent  Trump 's transition to the Department of Agriculture. So they had - they were just left waiting for a long time.
LEWIS: He's not the first person who's appointed by  Trump  to go in and be the transition person. But the first two people I think had problems because they were a lobbyist for  like  the soda industry. (Laughter) And there was protests about that person being involved in such an enterprise because  among other things  the USDA is responsible for the nation's nutrition and understanding it and promoting good nutrition. So the first guy who actually shows up and is still there is named Klippenstein  and he comes from an operation called Protect The Harvest.
LEWIS: That kind of - yes  dogfighting and circuses and  you know  poultry farming. And wherever animals might be mistreated  the USDA has some responsibility to monitor it. And anyway  so this guy - but he's a one-man transition team. And the thing that's bewildering to the people inside the USDA who thought they were going to be passing the baton and explaining to the  Trump  administration how the Department of Agriculture works is that they thought this is a job for 20 people to be done over 80 days  not one person over a couple of weeks. So the feeling generally inside the institution was that the transition never really happened  and the people who eventually come in never really got the briefings.
Essentially there was a witch hunt across the government for scientists  policy people who were responsible for responding to climate change because the position of the   [TGT]   administration was that basically it didn't exist. And so the career civil servant who was asked for the names of people in the Department of Agriculture who might be involved in  say  researching climate change refused to give up names. So that got shut down right away.
DAVIES: Eventually a larger team of   [TGT]   appointees did arrive at the Department of Agriculture. Who were they? What kind of backgrounds did they bring?
What concerned her was  first  who  Trump  had nominated to be her replacement - an Iowa right-wing talk show radio host named Sam Clovis  who had absolutely no background in science  whose chief qualification seems to have been he was just really loyal to   [TGT]  . He was co-chairman of   [TGT]  's campaign. And she  like everybody else  was mystified because while you can understand why political loyalists need to find their homes inside of an administration  why put him in a place where you actually have to know something? You know  why put him in charge of the science end of the Department of Agriculture  especially since so much of that research that's being done is one way or another related to climate change? And he doesn't think climate change exists.
DAVIES: I want to come back to Sam Clovis  the guy that the  Trump  administration nominated as the chief scientist for the Department of Agriculture who you say didn't have a background in science  was a talk show host. What do we know about his effect on the science program in the Department of Agriculture so far?
So this is to me - there's a theme in the sort of risks that the  Trump  administration are taking by putting people who are not suited for jobs into the jobs. And one of the themes is that they're - a willingness to tax the distant future for the political present because the distant future really doesn't have a voice at the table.
DAVIES: My guest is Michael Lewis. His article is about the  Trump  administration's impact on departments of the federal government appear in Vanity Fair. Since our interview was recorded  the president's pick to be chief scientist of the Agriculture Department  Sam Clovis  has withdrawn his nomination. It was revealed that last year  Clovis was the  Trump  campaign supervisor of George Papadopoulos  who tried to broker a relationship between the campaign and Russian officials and has admitted lying about it to the FBI. We'll hear more of our interview with Michael Lewis after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Michael Lewis  the author of ""Moneyball"" and other books. His latest is ""The Undoing Project."" He has some articles now in Vanity Fair about how the  Trump  administration is reshaping the work of several federal departments  among them the Departments of Agriculture and the Department of Energy. I want to talk about the energy department. The energy department had reams of briefing material ready for the  Trump  team when they arrived. Who showed up  if anyone?
LEWIS: Nobody showed up the day after the election. They - and they were  too - were expecting 20 to 30 people roll in. And they were especially alarmed because like the Department of Agriculture  the energy department is misnamed. It really is misleading. You think it's about energy. It's really more about nuclear weapons. It's where the nuclear stockpile is maintained. And because they're in the middle of national security issues - and they were terrified that the   [TGT]   administration was not going to know what it needed to know.
It'd be like  how do we maintain the nuclear stockpile  or  what's going on with a nuclear cleanup in Eastern Washington - very technical things. And I would also give you guidance on how the place runs. But the  Trump  administration took - clearly took the view that they had nothing to learn at all from the people who had been running the place for the last eight years.
DAVIES: You write that there was - what was called as a beachhead team  some group of   [TGT]   staffers who showed up. What did you hear that they did?",Positive,Negative,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive

5233,The Year of Trump Has Laid Bare the U.S. Constitutionâs Serious Flaws,Trump,"The Year of Trump  Has Laid Bare the U.S. Constitutionâs Serious Flaws
Usually  I have managed to deflect these challenges  arguing that my book was a homage to a founding ideal  not to the necessarily flawed reality. But itâs time for me to admit my doubts about its core idea â its admiration for the US constitution and system of government. For this first year of  the Donald Trump presidency  has exposed two flaws in the model that I cannot brush aside so easily.
The first is that  Trump  has vividly demonstrated that much of what keeps a democracy intact is not enshrined in the written letter of a constitution  but resides instead in customs and conventions â norms â that are essential to civic wellbeing.  Trump  trampled all over those as a candidate â refusing to disclose  his  tax returns  for example â and has trampled over even more as president.
Convention dictated that  he  had to divest  himself  of private business concerns on taking office  to prevent a conflict of interest â but in the absence of a law explicitly forcing  him  to do so   he  did no such thing. The same goes for appointing unqualified relatives to senior jobs  sacking the director of the FBI with no legitimate cause  or endorsing an accused child molester for the US Senate. No law told  him   he  couldnât  so  he  did.
I once thought the US constitution â a document crafted with almost mathematical precision  constructing a near-perfect equilibrium of checks and balances â offered protection against such perils. And thereâs no denying that that text  as interpreted by the courts  has indeed acted as a partial roadblock in  Trumpâs  path  delaying and diluting his Muslim-focused âtravel banâ  for example.
But this year of  Trump  has also shown the extent to which the US has an unwritten constitution that â just like ours â relies on the self-restraint of the key political players  a self-restraint usually insisted upon by a free press. Yet when confronted with a leader unbound by any sense of shame â and shamelessness might just be  Trumpâs  defining quality â America is left unexpectedly vulnerable.
Of course  there is a remedy  and its name is impeachment. Scholars are clear that  Trump  has already provided sufficient legal grounds for such a move â the case against  him  is far more compelling than the one against Bill Clinton. But impeachment proceedings are triggered by the House of Representatives  followed by a trial in the Senate  and nothing will happen so long as Republicans control both houses of Congress.
In 2017 we saw with new clarity that the strength of the US constitution depends entirely on the willingness of those charged with enforcing it to do their duty. And todayâs Republicans refuse to fulfil that obligation. They  like  Trump   are without shame. This was a fatal oversight by Hamilton  James Madison and their fellow framers of the constitution. They did not reckon on a partisanship so intense it would blind elected representatives to the national interest â so that they would  repeatedly  put party ahead of country. The founders did not conceive of a force like todayâs Republican party  willing to indulge a president nakedly hostile to ideals Americans once held sacred.
My 1998 self asks me whether  say  the Westminster parliament would really be so different if confronted by a Trump-like would-be autocrat. Would individual MPs suppress their own revulsion and back him  fearing deselection by party activists if they did not â much as congressional Republicans wonât move against  Trump  lest they face the wrath of his base? Itâs conceivable. And yet a parliamentary vote of no confidence is a lower hurdle than impeachment. Put simply  it would be easier to get rid of a British  Trump . And these weaknesses in the US model have prompted me to see others. The second amendment does not compel Americans to allow an unrestricted flow of guns into the hands of the violent and dangerous  but the fact that the argument hinges on interpretations of a text written more than two centuries ago is itself a problem. It means America  in the words of that great revolutionary Thomas Paine  is too often âlike dead and living bodies chained togetherâ  todayâs generation shackled to the words of their ancestors. And yet  despite everything  I still see so much to admire in the founding achievement of America. The society remains innovative  restless and creative: itâs still capable of producing a work of genius like Hamilton. But its next act of renewal might be to update or amend the text that gave it birth  to declare that no human invention  no matter how great  can remain stuck. Were he around  I suspect that âbastard  orphan  son of a whore and a Scotsmanâ would agree.","The Year of  [TGT] Has Laid Bare the U.S. Constitutionâs Serious Flaws

5234,What if Trump did try to fire Mueller? Why does it matter?,Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â  President Donald Trump  pushed back against reports that  he  ordered White House lawyer Don McGahn to fire special counsel Robert Mueller last June.
âFake news  folks. Fake news. Typical New York Times fake stories â  Trump  retorted dismissively when asked about it by reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland.
The reports  first by the Times and then others  said  Trump  backed off on  his  attempt to fire the man who is investigating  him    his  election campaignâs Russian contacts and  his  firings of FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn â but only after lawyer McGahn refused to relay  his  directive to the Justice Department and threatened to quit if  Trump  pressed the issue.
After the news came out Thursday night  Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia quickly accused  Trump  of crossing âa red lineâ that should be met forcibly by lawmakers to protect the Constitution. Warner is the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. But Republicans were quick to dismiss the report  pointing out that Mueller had not actually been fired.
Some legal experts noted that presidents  like anyone else  can say things they donât mean when angry. At the same time  others saw the alleged  Trump  order as part of a pattern of obstruction that could be pressed by Mueller  disrupting or even dooming Trumpâs presidency.
That said  this latest revelation isnât the only example of presidential action that could be seen as an attempt to interfere with an investigation of  Trump  and  his  campaign. Another is the firing Comey as FBI director last May. Mueller was appointed special counsel by Rod Rosenstein  the deputy attorney general  after Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped aside because of his own close involvement with the  Trump  campaign.
Or it could be part of an obstruction case against  Trump  or others.
Meanwhile  despite the sensational nature of the Times report  there is likely little that Mueller doesnât already know about events in the White House. More than 20 White House employees have given interviews to the special counselâs team investigating possible obstruction and  Trump  campaign ties to Russian election interference.
 John Dowd  one of Trumpâs attorneys   said the White House  in what  he  called an âunprecedentedâ display of cooperation with Muellerâs investigation  has turned over more than 20 000 pages of records. The presidentâs 2016 campaign has turned over more than 1.4 million pages.
 An additional 28 people affiliated with the Trump campaign  have been interviewed by either the special counsel or congressional committees probing Russian election meddling. Dowd did not name  the people  nor provide a breakdown of how many were interviewed only by Muellerâs team.
 Trumpâs  national approval numbers are low  but  his  conservative base has kept up its solid support through all the criticism  he  has come under in  his  first year as president. Why would this be any different?
In Congress  Democrats have been quick to exploit the report. Warner called Trumpâs actions âa gross abuse of power.â However  Republicans noted that the purported order came long ago and before  Trump  surrounded  himself  with new lawyers. Since then   his  public demeanor toward Mueller has changed.
 Trump  has softened  his  public criticism of Mueller  White House officials say over and over that  he  has nothing to hide  and  his  lawyers have signaled they are cooperating  too.
Muellerâs investigators hope to interview  Trump  soon.
âIâm looking forward to it  actually â  Trump  said when asked by reporters. As for timing   he  said  âI guess theyâre talking about two or three weeks  but Iâd love to do it.â

5236,U.S. charges Russians with 2016 U.S. election tampering to boost Trump,Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Russian propaganda arm oversaw a criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to support  Donald Trump  and disparage Hillary Clinton  said an indictment released on Friday that revealed more details than previously known about Moscowâs purported effort to interfere.
The surprise 37-page indictment could alter the divisive U.S. domestic debate over Russiaâs meddling  undercutting some Republicans who  along with  Trump   have attacked Muellerâs investigation.
The indictment is silent on the question of whether  the Trump campaign  colluded with the Kremlin  which Mueller is investigating.
In a tweet on Friday   Trump  gave  his  most direct acknowledgement that Russia had meddled in the election  which  he  has frequently disputed.
âRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014  long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted.  The Trump campaign  did nothing wrong - no collusion!â  Trump  wrote.
The indictment broadly echoes the conclusions of a January 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment  which found that Russia had meddled in the election  and that its goals eventually included aiding  Trump . In November 2016   Trump  won a surprise victory over Democratic Party candidate Clinton.
 Trump  has never unequivocally accepted the U.S. intelligence report and has denounced Muellerâs probe as a âwitch hunt.â
Some of those charged  posing as Americans  âcommunicated with unwitting individuals associated with the  Trump  campaign â the indictment said.

 The president  is scheduled to make a visit to Puerto Rico on Tuesday  and when asked if  he  would meet with Cruz after  his  derogatory and baseless claims  a White House official said  ""not sure "" according to ABC News.

5238,A Pentagon chart misleadingly suggests the U.S. is falling behind in a nuclear arms race,Trump,"A former colleague suggested that  a chart published in the Trump administrationâs Nuclear Posture Review (NPR)  might be worthy of a fact check  saying it reminded him of exaggerations concerning Soviet military power during  the Reagan administration . Ordinarily  a chart buried in a government report might not merit a fact check  but clearly itâs important to  the administration . As shown in the quote above  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis even cited it in testimony before Congress.
 The chart  purports to show that Russia  China and North Korea have raced ahead of the United States in developing new nuclear systems since the last NPR was released in 2010. Ironically   the chart  already had caused controversy because  it  initially suggested that Taiwan was part of China  an embarrassing error that led the Defense Department to pull the document and fix the image of China.
But thatâs really a minor flub compared with the inconsistent and misleading way  the chart  compares the United States with its nuclear adversaries. Letâs take a look.
 The chart  appears on Page 8 in a section that argues that since 2010  when President Barack Obama pressed to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in strategic policy  rivals have moved ahead. âWhile the United States has continued to reduce the number and salience of nuclear weapons  others  including Russia and China  have moved in the opposite direction â the NPR says. Referencing the chart  the NPR says it âillustrates the marked difference between U.S. efforts to reduce the salience of nuclear weapons and the contrary actions of others over the past decade.â
 The chart  is hard to read and has little detail  so  it  appears mainly intended to serve a propaganda purpose â at one glance  one would get the impression that the United States has stood still while the other nations have raced ahead. Mattis even claimed that adversaries had developed 34 ânew systemsâ compared with just one for the United States.
Interestingly  the Russian SS-27 has been equipped with multiple reentry vehicles in apparent violation of the START treaty. âThe Russians claimed it was a ânewâ missile to avoid admitting the violation  but the U.S. largely used the designation Mod 2 to indicate otherwise â Lewis said. âThe Trump administration has now retroactively assessed the Russians as being in compliance to make a PR point. Russia announced that deployment of the Yars would start in December 2009 after the START treaty expired.â

5239,Morning News Brief : NPR,Donald Trump,"SNELL:  Trump  really caught Congress off guard with all of this. Most of the Republicans I talked to  particularly in the Senate  said that this was kind of a ham-fisted and not very well-tailored approach to addressing the issues that  Trump  says  he  wants to address  which is that there are these cheap imports of steel and aluminum coming into the U.S. and making it difficult for the U.S. to sell its exports of aluminum and steel. So as Republicans have been responding  they say that they would have been happier with something that either had carve-outs for our trade partners  like the EU and Canada  or were more directed specifically at the countries they wanted to get to.
MARTIN: Although  I've got to say  why were they so surprised? I mean   Donald Trump  has been erratic  I think we can say  on DACA.  He  has flipped on guns. But in terms of trade  this is something that this man has been pretty consistent on  at least since the '80s.
SNELL: Sure. So the thing that they were surprised about is that  he  kind of went around the normal way of things. Which  again  shouldn't be surprising for this president. But  he  didn't go through the normal channels  and there really isn't an opportunity for Congress to soften the blow of this because it is more or less a unilateral decision by the White House.
INSKEEP: Took even  his  advisers by surprise in many cases. So I hate to pretend that we know what's coming up this week - 'cause we certainly didn't know what was coming up last week - but  lawmakers are expected to vote on a major rewrite of financial industry rules.

5240,The Supreme Court cancels a travel,Trump,"THREE months after the Supreme Court gave  the Trump administration  a provisional green-light to implement  its  second try at a ban on travel from several majority-Muslim countries  the justices have scrapped a hearing scheduled for October 10th at which the order would have faced a final legal reckoning. The parties in  Trump v International Refugee Assistance Project  and Trump v Hawaii have until October 5th to send new briefs to the justices outlining where the litigation should go next  but in the meantime  the cases have been wiped off the argument calendar.
 Donald Trumpâs  March 6th order banning all travel from six countriesâIran  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria  and Yemenâwas not received well by the judiciary. Appeals courts concluded in the spring that the restrictions  along with a ban on refugees  seemed to violate the First Amendment or exceed presidential power under federal immigration law. On June 26th  the Supreme Court issued an injunction staying those rulings  saying Mr Trumpâs ban could go into effect to block foreigners except for those claiming relatives or formal connections in America. The justices agreed to hear the full case in the autumn.
Over the weekend  when  Mr Trump  issued a new presidential proclamation  the question of mootness took on particular significance. Rather than just let the order fizzle  or re-up it as-is   Mr Trump  issued a revised ban that arguably satisfied  his  recently-tweeted preference for âlarger  tougher and more specificâ travel restrictions. One country  Sudan  came off the verboten list  while three were added: North Korea  Chad and Venezuela. At first glance  these edits gave the new order a more evenhanded veneer: three new countries on three different continents  only one of which (Chad) is Muslim-majority. But on only slightly closer inspection  the changes were rather minor. North Korea  the regime  Mr Trump  has been threatening with complete destruction (and which has been vehemently returning that rhetoric)  does not exactly supply a steady stream of tourists to America. The restrictions on Venezuela are limited to a handful of government officials and their families.
Anthony Romero of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says the refinements to the travel ban do not ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½obfuscate the real fact that the administration's order is still a Muslim banâ.  Mr Trump âs âoriginal sin of targeting Muslims cannot be curedâ  Mr Romero says  âby throwing other countries onto his enemies listâ. The administration insists that non-Muslim countries were added to the list for legitimate reasonsâand not to make the order less legally fraught. In a âresponse to queriesâ   the administration answers the key questionââIsnât this just a way to ban Muslims from entering the country?ââthis way: âReligion was not a factor...The goal is to enhance information sharing practices in order to keep Americans safe and to improve overall global securityâ. And then  in a larger font and with a typo  this hastily penned addendum: âIn addition  both Muslin [sic] and Non-Muslim majority countries were identifiedâ.
Whatever the motive behind the tweaks  they make the proclamation less likely to provoke unfavourable rulings from federal judges. The legal challenges to the earlier travel bans were never open-and-shut: despite the plaintiffsâ success at the district and circuit court levels  the Supreme Courtâs five-justice conservative majority would have been difficult to persuade that  Mr Trumpâs  order was an illegitimate exercise of presidential animus toward Muslims. The revisions might be mere window-dressing  but given the latitude presidents enjoy in matters of immigration and foreign policy  they may be  all Mr Trump  needs to defend  his  new travel ban once the lawsuits start flying.","THREE months after the Supreme Court gave   [TGT] a provisional green-light to implement   [TGT]   second try at a ban on travel from several majority-Muslim countries  the justices have scrapped a hearing scheduled for October 10th at which the order would have faced a final legal reckoning.

5242,Trump might have Middle East peace plan soon,Trump,"Both Israeli and Palestinian officials believe  President Donald Trump  is prepping a big Middle East peace plan that could be unveiled within weeks.
Meetings at the UN General Assembly last week convinced both Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that  Trump  was serious about a peace plan.
In a sideline meeting at the UN before Abbas' address to the body   Trump  reportedly told the Palestinian leader that the US is close to putting the final touches on a plan  according to Shlomi Eldar  writing in Al-Monitor.
""It was a good talk  perhaps the best President Abbas has had with  Trump  "" an anonymous Palestinian source told Al-Monitor.
The Palestinian leader appears to take  Trump  seriously. The Palestinian Authority â which governs the Palestinian territories â has agreed to wait for the US proposal before taking any significant diplomatic steps  according to Haaretz.
Israeli leadership also suggested that  Trump  was serious about the peace process following the UN General Assembly.
"" Trump  conveyed  his  seriousness about this. The Americans are preparing a plan  and I presented our positions to the president "" Netanyahu told a meeting of his security cabinet  according to a separate report in Haaretz. "" Trump  is very determined and wants to reach the ultimate deal.""

5244,Senate rejects immigration bills; young immigrants in limbo,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â The Senate has left hundreds of thousands of âDreamerâ immigrants in limbo  rejecting rival plans that would have spared them from deportation and strengthened the nationâs border security. Senators dealt  President Donald Trump  an especially galling defeat as more than a quarter of fellow Republicans abandoned  him  on an issue that helped propel  him  to the White House.
Also defeated Thursday was a plan by a bipartisan group of senators who offered a compromise that would have shielded the young immigrants and financed Trumpâs demands for money to build  his  border wall  though more gradually than  he  wants. Eight Republicans joined most Democrats in backing that plan  but it fell short after the White House threatened a veto and GOP leaders opposed it.
The Senate votes left the young immigrants facing a March 5 deadline that  Trump  has given Congress for restoring the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  or DACA  that he annulled last year. Federal courts have blocked him temporarily from dismantling the Obama-era initiative  but without congressional action the immigrants will face growing risks of deportation as their protections expire.
âIt looks like demagogues on the left and the right win again on immigration â said Sen. Lindsey Graham  R-S.C.  who helped craft the bipartisan package but also backed  Trump âs plan. He added  âThe only way forward is for  President Trump  to grab the reins and lead us to a solution.â
That scenario wasnât in sight Thursday. The White House trashed the bipartisan proposal as âdangerous policy that will harm the nation â denouncing a provision directing the government to prioritize enforcement efforts against immigrants who arrive illegally â beginning in July.  Trump  proved unwilling to fold on  his  demands for a tougher bill  reflecting the hard-line immigration stance that fueled  his  presidential run.
After the Senate rejected all four proposals on Thursday  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R-Ky.  blamed Democrats for failing to accept what he said was a âgenerousâ offer from  Trump .
 Trump  had dangled a chance for citizenship for 1.8 million young immigrants  meeting a top Democratic demand. But that plan also included $25 billion to build  his  border wall with Mexico and enact other border security measures  tighter curbs on relatives whom legal immigrants could sponsor for citizenship and an end to a visa lottery that encourages immigration from diverse nations.
Democrats said  Trump  was the major hindrance to a broader deal.","WASHINGTON (AP) â The Senate has left hundreds of thousands of âDreamerâ immigrants in limbo  rejecting rival plans that would have spared them from deportation and strengthened the nationâs border security.

5245,Special counsel Mueller indicts 13 Russians for election interference,Donald Trump,"The Internet Research Agency  based in St. Petersburg  was named in the indictment as the hub of an ambitious effort to trick Americans online into following and promoting Russian-fed propaganda that pushed 2016 voters toward then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and away from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
Prosecutors said the Russians  using fake identities  contacted  Trump  campaign staffers in Florida offering to hold rallies to support  Trump . Susie Wiles  who was co-chair of the  Trump  campaign in Florida in August 2016 and later became the campaignâs chief Florida staffer  said no campaign official was aware of the Russian effort.
âItâs not the way I do the business; itâs not the way the  Trump  campaign in Florida did business â she said. âIt is spooky. It is awful. It makes you look over your shoulder. It shouldnât happen. Iâm anxious for this to be uncovered so this never happens again.â
Some of the Russians posed as Americans and  without revealing their Russian identities  âcommunicated with unwitting individuals associated with the  Trump  campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities â the indictment said.

5246,Adult,Donald Trump,"An adult-film star who was reportedly paid to remain silent about a sexual relationship with  Donald Trump  a decade before  he  became president spoke to a journalist because she feared he would not pay up  according to a new account.
""Daniels said she was talking to me and sharing these details because  Trump  was stalling on finalizing the confidentiality agreement and paying  her  "" Weisberg wrote. ""Given her experience with  Trump   she suspected he would stall her until after the election  and then refuse to sign or pay up.""
Also on Tuesday  Alana Evans  another adult-film star  said in a television interview on ""Megyn Kelly Today"" that Clifford had called her to invite her to a hotel room with  Trump   who at the time was a reality television star.
Both accounts emerged four days after the Wall Street Journal reported that not long before the 2016 presidential election  Clifford was paid $130 000 by a lawyer for  Trump  to remain quiet about any relationship  she  had with the future president.
Cohen has dismissed ""rumors [that] have circulated time and again since 2011"" and said both  Trump  and Clifford ""vehemently denies any such occurrence."" Cohen also issued a statement he said was signed by Daniels  which describes rumors about her getting ""hush money from  Donald Trump "" as ""completely false.""
The Slate story adds another layer to the Journal report  which landed amid a furor over profane remarks  Trump  made during a meeting on immigration last week.
Clifford said she had met  Trump  at a celebrity golf tournament in 2006 â the year after he married Melania Trump  now the first lady â and they began a relationship that lasted for nearly a year  Weisberg wrote.
Weisberg continued that Clifford did not allege any abuse  saying only that  Trump  had made promises  he  would break  such as vowing to feature her on  his  ""Apprentice"" television show. To try and corroborate Clifford's account  Weisberg said he spoke to three of her friends  all of whom said they knew about the relationship and ""confirmed the outlines of her story.""
Clifford sought money for her story and was also motivated by ""her anger about  Trump 's newfound opposition to abortion and gay marriage "" Weisberg wrote. However  Clifford stopped responding to Slate a week before the election  and a friend said she had ""taken the money from  Trump  after all "" he wrote.
At that time   Trump 's history with women was a significant factor in the campaign. In October 2016  The Washington Post published a recording from 2005 that captured  Trump  bragging in graphic terms about groping women. A parade of women soon emerged to accuse  Trump  of sexual misconduct  charges that he denied during the campaign.
As the country has confronted a wave of sexual misconduct claims against high-profile men in recent months  the accusations against  Trump  flooded back into the news. Some of the women who had accused him had questioned why charges felled men like Harvey Weinstein while  Trump  was unscathed  and late last year  they made a renewed push for public attention. The White House had dismissed the allegations and said any questions were answered when  Trump  won the presidency.
One of  Trump 's accusers  a former ""Apprentice"" contestant  filed a defamation case against him due to his denials during the campaign. If a judge allows the case to proceed  attorneys could call other women to the stand to testify about their encounters with  Trump .
After the Journal's story reporting the settlement last week was published   Trump  and the White House assailed the publication for a different story  arguing that the newspaper deliberately misquoted one of his comments during an interview he gave to multiple reporters there.

5247,How Bad Is The Trade Climate? Here's A New Measure,Trump,"The Trump administration  this week slapped substantial tariffs on imports of large washing machines and solar cells. The move drew particular attention because President Trumpâs protectionist rhetoric had not  to date  been matched with significant new protection. Do the new tariffs mark the start of a trade war? Just how serious is the situation?
The military has a way of addressing such questions: DEFCON  a scale ranging from 5 (tranquil) to 1 (most alarming) is meant to portray âDEFense CONditions.â We do not have a corresponding measure in trade  but given the concerns about where  the Trump administration  is heading  we need one. Soâ¦
This has been our recent norm. Certain practices to impede trade have gained fairly wide acceptance. Prominent among these are anti-dumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) procedures. These are permitted under the WTO and result in substantial amounts of protection. But in the United States  the White House has no role in the process. While  the Trump administration has tried to take credit for some of these cases   they are normally launched by businesses and decided by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) and the Commerce Department. Nominally  the President could not stop a case even if he wanted to. That may be unfortunate for consumers  but it also means that new tariffs applied this way are not usually taken as evidence of a countryâs aggressive policy.

The President also has discretion over the breadth of the protection applied  including which exporting countries might be exempt from the new tariffs. President Trump notably included Mexico in the new tariffs  even though the ITC had determined that Mexican washing machine tariffs posed no threat to U.S. industry.
. Here is where the new action on washers and solar cells fits in. It was not an AD/CVD case. Instead  the administration dusted off a provision of trade law unused since 2002 â a âsafeguardâ provision of trade law intended to provide temporary relief for domestic industries that have been hurt by imports. Unlike AD/CVD  the White House does have discretion on whatever action is taken  including the ability to deny protection if the President thinks tariffs would hurt the public interest. That discretion was one reason that safeguards had become less popular among businesses seeking tariff protection â the AD/CVD cases seemed less likely to fall prey to considerations of consumer or diplomatic interests. The President also has discretion over the breadth of the protection applied  including which exporting countries might be exempt from the new tariffs.  President Trump  notably included Mexico in the new tariffs  even though the ITC had determined that Mexican washing machine tariffs posed no threat to U.S. industry. It is important to note that safeguard procedures are consistent with WTO agreements  if implemented properly. The last time the United States tried this  the WTO ultimately ruled that the 2002 steel safeguard tariffs were not implemented properly and the Bush administration withdrew them.

Measures that seriously undercut trade rules  albeit in an orderly way .
A move by the  Trump  administration to withdraw from NAFTA would take us to TRADCON 2. It is technically permissible under both WTO rules and the provisions of NAFTA itself and it would still leave WTO strictures in place  but it starts to dismantle the rules-based trading system.
Another example of a move to TRADCON 2 would be flagrant disregard of an important WTO ruling. Suppose  for example  that South Korea prevails in its challenge to  the new safeguard tariffs and the Trump administration  were to decide to keep  them  in place anyway. Technically  under the WTO  a country is permitted to keep its new protection in place; it just faces the consequence of authorized retaliation by countries that were wronged. But such moves similarly threaten the system.

So how bad was  the new protectionist move by President Trump ?  It  took us to TRADCON 3.  It âs ill-advised policy and a reason for concern  but it could be worse.

5248,Trump âs opioid announcement is as empty as his Trump U promises,Trump,"President Trump  declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency on Oct. 26. Here are the highlights from  his  speech. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)
 President Trump  is and will always be a carnival barker  a snake-oil salesman  a flim-flam artist who dresses up a lot of nothing in showy garb.  He âs gotten people to buy  his  crummy steaks  stay in gaudy hotels and pay thousands of dollars for  Trump U.  With that in mind  you can fully appreciate  his  announcement on opioids on Thursday.
 President Trump  said Thursday that the opioid epidemic â which is killing more than 100 people each day â is the âworst drug crisis in American historyâ and said  his  administration is declaring it a public health emergency  pledging the nationâs full resolve in overcoming it. . . . With  Trumpâs  declaration  the federal government will waive some regulations  give states more flexibility in how they use federal funds and expand the use of telemedicine treatment  according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on Thursday morning.
But  the president  stopped short of declaring a more sweeping national state of emergency that would have given states access to funding from the federal Disaster Relief Fund  just as they would have had following a tornado or hurricane.
Thatâs it? A speech and some regulatory mumbo-jumbo? Welcome to the world of oversold  underperforming  Trump  bric-a-bracs. Now wonder then that â Trumpâs  announcement drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and some public health advocates  who questioned his commitment to the crisis  given that  Trump  made no immediate request to Congress for emergency funding.â
And that bait and switch â an emergency announcement accompanied by no new resources â is not the worst of it.  He  spent the first nine months of  his  presidency trying to eviscerate the most important source of funding for opioid addiction treatment â Medicaid. And the GOP budget envisions  according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities  âa cut of $1.8 trillion in health entitlement programs  including $473 billion in Medicare and $1.3 trillion primarily in Medicaid and subsidies to make coverage affordable through the ACA marketplaces.â
The president has not provided direction or funds to resolve many endemic problems in treatment of opioid abuse â a shortage of treatment providers  failure to integrate mental health treatment into the larger health care system  patientsâ reticence to seek treatment because of the stigma associated with addiction. As Andy Slavitt  former head of CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) tweeted  âThis is i/2 baked at best  cynical lip service at worst.â He points out that Trump has âcommitted no money  named no leader and has no plan he can articulate.â Slavitt tells me  âDeclaring an emergency with no funds  while putting forward this budget is on net a very bad day for people suffering from addiction. â
Trumpâs  way of addressing opioids â lots of show and self-congratulatory cheerleading but little substance â should surprise no one who has followed his career. Unfortunately  there are real victims here who will not benefit from  Trumpâs  showmanship. To the contrary  they may find on net fewer resources and less access to treatment. You see  when you actually need someone to address real problems and operate the levers of government  a president with no experience  no interest in details and no willingness to prioritize tax-and-spend policies to protect the safety net is a serious impediment to action â which in this case means the death toll from opioid abuse will not decrease anytime soon.","[TGT] declared the opioid crisis a national public health emergency on Oct. 26.

In an interview with Reuters  Short also said  Trump  wanted a corporate tax rate of 20 percent in the tax cut package being debated in Congress despite the president saying recently that it could end up higher.
 Trump  held a meeting with Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress on Thursday to work on bridging differences over the U.S. budget and avoid a stop in government services.
âIâm hopeful that ... we find a pathway to get a two-year budget cap dealâ that enables budget writers to put together a bill for fiscal year 2018 with boundaries for fiscal year 2019 as well   he  said.
 Trump âs recent reference to a possible 22-percent corporate tax rate was only a product of conversations  he  had had with lawmakers  Short said.
âI think  he  was just reflecting what conversations  he  had heard from them  but that ... wasnât intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate â  he  said.
Short said he expected Congress to approve the Republicansâ tax effort this year  though  Trump  may not sign it until 2018.
Short  who is the top interlocutor between the White House and Congress and has become a frequent guest on television to explain Trumpâs policies  suggested he was staying put despite a recent report saying he could leave the administration.","FILE PHOTO:   [TGT] speaks about tax reform legislation during a visit to St. Louis  Missouri  U.S. November 29  2017.

  [TGT] held a meeting with Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress on Thursday to work on bridging differences over the U.S. budget and avoid a stop in government services.
âIâm hopeful that ... we find a pathway to get a two-year budget cap dealâ that enables budget writers to put together a bill for fiscal year 2018 with boundaries for fiscal year 2019 as well    [TGT]   said.
  [TGT]  âs recent reference to a possible 22-percent corporate tax rate was only a product of conversations   [TGT]   had had with lawmakers  Short said.
âI think   [TGT]   was just reflecting what conversations   [TGT]   had heard from them  but that ... wasnât intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate â   [TGT]   said.
Short said he expected Congress to approve the Republicansâ tax effort this year  though   [TGT]   may not sign  [TGT]  until 2018.

5251,No  Trump doesnât need a mental fitness evaluation,Trump,"President Trump waves while departing for Camp David on the South Lawn of the White House in December. (Chris Kleponis/Bloomberg News)
 President Trump  is scheduled to have  his  annual medical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday. Many people  including some of my prominent psychiatric colleagues  think it should include a mandatory mental fitness evaluation.
Even without experts weighing in  the public has more than a reasonable basis to question  Trump âs mental capacity to serve as the countryâs leader. After all   he  is famously impulsive  dishonest  thin-skinned and unpredictable. Such characteristics would impair any chief executive; in a president  they are a threat to the country.
As some critics question  President Trump 's mental fitness  many psychiatrists are being reminded of the Goldwater Rule. Here's what you need to know about it. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)
The publication of Michael Wolffâs âFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White Houseâ last week reignited concern about  Trump âs cognitive function. In response   the president  took to Twitter to defend  his  mental fitness  describing  himself  as a âvery stable genius.â But  his  boastful cognitive self-assessment stands in stark contrast to  his  often rambling and incoherent statements  ultra-short attention span  repetitive speech pattern and rather impoverished vocabulary â all of which understandably invite worry by any layperson about  his  cognitive state.
So what would an expert mental fitness evaluation add to our understanding of  Trump ? Typically  a psychiatric evaluation involves an in-depth interview  history taking and collection of laboratory data that might reveal hidden biological contributors to various abnormal mental states. This approach is particularly useful in diagnosing more subtle forms of psychiatric illness  such as mild anxiety  depressive states  or covert drug or alcohol abuse  which can color oneâs perception of the world and bias behavior.
But such an interview for  Trump  would likely be uninformative and largely irrelevant. The reason is that mental illness per se is not a bar to being president. In fact  one study based on biographical data suggests that mental illness is hardly a stranger to the White House: 18 of Americaâs first 37 presidents met criteria for a psychiatric disorder during their lifetimes â 10 of whom showed signs of mental illness while in the White House.
What about conducting neurocognitive testing on  Trump ? Such tests could quantitatively assess cognitive functions such as attention  memory  verbal comprehension and analytical reasoning. But even mild deficits in attention or short-term memory would hardly disqualify a president from service. A president with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or dyslexia  for example  would manifest predictable deficits on neuropsychological testing  but no one would argue that this would be a dealbreaking impairment.
Sure  some speculate that  Trump  is showing signs that can be indications of dementia affecting the prefrontal cortex  given  his  poor impulse control and difficulty constructing a logical argument. Perhaps  but these traits apparently have been characteristic of Trumpâs behavior for quite some time. And when you see such enduring behavior in the average person  it makes dementia questionable.
There is another reason my colleagues should be hesitant to provide a diagnosis from afar or encourage Congress and the Cabinet to remove  Trump  under the 25th Amendment. All our diagnoses are clinical in nature  requiring some degree of subjective judgment. Unlike  say  an EKG or cholesterol level  which speak for themselves  our opinions are unlikely to be free of personal or political bias any more than those of the Supreme Court justices.
Much of the public would inevitably view expert intervention as a politically motivated attempt to disqualify a sitting president  whether true or not. That is something our profession must avoid  unless we have knowledge and insight that were inaccessible and vital to the publicâs well-being  which is clearly not the case with  Trump .
In the end  neither the public nor Congress needs the advice of us psychiatric experts. The most accurate measure of a personâs fitness  whether mental or physical  is observable function in the real world â not the results of a fancy test or expert opinion. The fact is that Americans already have all the data they need to judge Trumpâs fitness.","President Trump waves while departing for Camp David on the South Lawn of the White House in December.

5252,Trump attacks Democrats' patriotism raises specter of 'treason',Trump,"In a Wall Street Journal interview a few weeks ago   Donald Trump  lashed out at some FBI officials and suggested they may be guilty of âtreason.â When the interviewer tried to move on  the president wouldnât let it go  making two more references to âtreasonousâ acts.
Yesterday   Trump  was in Ohio  ostensibly to talk about how impressed  he  is with  his  regressive tax plan  but the president strayed from his script and reflected on the partisan differences in how his State of the Union address was perceived.
For the right  the fact that  Trump  was âplaying this for laughs â and using a âflippantâ tone  made the rhetoric less offensive.
Itâs a tough sell. As Jon Chait put it  âIt is totally beyond the pale for a president to describe the opposing party as having committed treason for failing to applaud his speech. It is the logic and rhetoric of authoritarianism in its purest form. But if  Trump  does  it  in the middle of a Don Ricklesâstyle riff  does that make it better? Worse? Just weirder?â
Whether one is inclined to laugh off the presidentâs rhetoric or not  the broader context is striking.  Trump  is supposed to be working on preventing another government shutdown and negotiating a bipartisan agreement on immigration policy. Instead   he  joshing about Democrats committing treason for failing to applaud  his  speech to  Trumpâs  satisfaction?
But even for those inclined to shrug off the âtreasonâ talk   Trumpâs  point wasnât subtle:  he  believes Democrats are lacking in patriotism. Indeed  the âtreasonâ references stood out  but note that the president also used phrases such as âun-Americanâ and âthey certainly didnât seem to love our country very much.â
The irony is   Trump  surrendered the high ground on patriotism quite a while ago. As regular readers know  this president is a poor messenger for this message.
Two weeks after taking office  for example   Trump  sat down for an interview in which  he  was reminded that Russian President Vladimir Putin is âa killer.â  Trump  replied  âThere are a lot of killers. Weâve got a lot of killers. What  do you think our countryâs so innocent?â
As we discussed at the time  Americans generally arenât accustomed to hearing their president be quite this critical of the United States â out loud and in public. Whatâs more  the idea that the U.S. chief executive sees a moral equivalence between us and an autocratic thug came as a reminder that  Trump  doesnât always hold  his  country in the highest regard.
Indeed  as regular readers may recall  the Republican hasnât exactly been subtle on this point. In December 2015  for example   then-candidate Trump  was asked about Putinâs habit of invading countries and killing critics. âHeâs running his country  and at least heâs a leader â  Trump  replied  âunlike what we have in this country.â Reminded that Putin has been accused of ordering the murder of critics and journalists   Trump  added  âWell  I think our country does plenty of killing also.â
Thereâs never been a president  from either party  whoâs been so cavalier about America lacking in credibility. Sentiments such as âWhen the world looks at how bad the United States isâ¦â are usually heard from Americaâs opponents  not Americaâs president.

 He  called for the release of information about who had financed the dossier  which has been verified in part by the FBI and the Senate Intelligence Committee  but also contains several unverified and salacious allegations.
 Trump  was also frustrated over the attention being paid to Facebook over  its  involvement in Russia's disinformation and trolling campaign during the 2016 election.
 President Donald Trump  unleashed  his  frustration over the ongoing Russia investigation in several tweets Saturday afternoon.
Addressing the dossier compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele  which alleges several ties between the  Trump  campaign and Russian officials   Trump  tweeted  ""Officials behind the now discredited 'Dossier' plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.""
It was the second time in as many days that  Trump  had called for the release of information about those who had financed the dossier  which was produced by the opposition-research firm  Fusion GPS. On Thursday  the day after Fusion officials appeared before the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session after being subpoenaed by chairman Devin Nunes   Trump  tweeted  ""Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it  Russia  the FBI or the Dems (or all)?""
The explosive dossier has not been verified in whole  but it is currently being used as a ""roadmap"" by the FBI as it conducts its own investigation into whether the  Trump  campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the 2016 race in  his  favor. The FBI also reportedly agreed to pay Steele in October 2016 to continue doing work that might help the bureau's Russia investigation. Special counsel Robert Mueller interviewed Steele  the document's author  during the summer  and the Senate Intelligence Committee also announced earlier this month that it had been working ""backwards"" to verify the dossier.
 Trump  also vented about the attention being paid to Facebook and other social media platforms after  it  emerged last month that Russian trolls capitalized on social media  and Facebook in particular  to sow discord during the election and spread pro-Trump propaganda.
""Keep hearing about 'tiny' amount of money spent on Facebook ads  "" Trump  tweeted on Saturday. ""What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN  ABC  NBC & CBS?""
 He  added: ""Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side  not mine!""
Former Russian troll Max told independent Russian news outlet Dozhd that the Internet Research Agency consisted of a ""Russian desk"" and a ""foreign desk.""

5255,The 'Missed Opportunity' Of Trump's Asia Trip : Parallels : NPR,Trump,"The 'Missed Opportunity' Of  Trump's Asia Trip
When  President Trump  returned this week from a 12-day  five-nation swing through Asia   he  gave  himself  high marks for the ""tremendous success of  this trip .""
But experts say that while  he  avoided major blunders during  his  stops in Japan  South Korea  Japan  Vietnam and the Philippines   the president  missed more than one opportunity to offer  his  administration's strategic vision for the region â the world's largest  most populous and fastest growing.
""It was all fluff "" says David Shambaugh  a professor of political science and international affairs at the Elliott School at George Washington University. ""Nothing came out of it except  Trump  flying in and being treated well  himself .""
Shambaugh points to the lavish dinners  honor guards at nearly every stop and the tea to which  the president  was treated in Beijing's Forbidden City as ""symbols"" that the Chinese and ""in fact  most Asian leaders  have figured out  Trump "" â by flattering  his  ego.
 Trump  reassured Japan's President Shinzo Abe and Prime Minister Moon Jae-In of South Korea of U.S. commitment; they in turn vowed to keep working toward the goal of a denuclearized North Korea and pledged some investments in the U.S.
"" He  did no harm "" says Shambaugh.
""All countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed  "" Trump  said after  he  returned. But on the roughly $300 billion trade imbalance between the U.S. and China   Trump  ""didn't get any structural changes "" notes Evan Medeiros  a managing director at the Eurasia Group and a former senior advisor to the Obama administration on Asia.
Perhaps the most eagerly anticipated part of the trip was  Trump 's speech in Danang  Vietnam  to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  a forum that promotes free trade throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
 Trump 's speech to the body was billed to outline the administration's overall strategy toward what the administration now calls a ""free and open Indo-Pacific.""

 Trump 's repeated use of the phrase ""Indo-Pacific"" followed a recent decision by the administration to redefine the ""Asia-Pacific"" region with a nod toward the growing importance of India and the role the administration would like the world's largest democracy to play in the region.","The 'Missed Opportunity' Of  Trump's Asia Trip
When   [TGT] returned this week from a 12-day  five-nation swing through Asia    [TGT]   gave   [TGT]   high marks for the ""tremendous success of  this trip .""
But experts say that while  he  avoided major blunders during  his  stops in Japan  South Korea  Japan  Vietnam and the Philippines    [TGT] missed more than one opportunity to offer   [TGT]   administration's strategic vision for the region â the world's largest  most populous and fastest growing.
""It was all fluff "" says David Shambaugh  a professor of political science and international affairs at the Elliott School at George Washington University. ""Nothing came out of it except   [TGT] flying in and being treated well   [TGT]  .""
Shambaugh points to the lavish dinners  honor guards at nearly every stop and the tea to which   [TGT] was treated in Beijing's Forbidden City as ""symbols"" that the Chinese and ""in fact  most Asian leaders  have figured out   [TGT]  "" â by flattering  his  ego.
  [TGT] reassured Japan's President Shinzo Abe and Prime Minister Moon Jae-In of South Korea of U.S. commitment; they in turn vowed to keep working toward the goal of a denuclearized North Korea and pledged some investments in the U.S.
"" He  did no harm "" says Shambaugh.
""All countries dealing with us on trade know that the rules have changed  ""  [TGT]   said after   [TGT]   returned. But on the roughly $300 billion trade imbalance between the U.S. and China    [TGT] ""didn't get any structural changes "" notes Evan Medeiros  a managing director at the Eurasia Group and a former senior advisor to the Obama administration on Asia.
Perhaps the most eagerly anticipated part of the trip was   [TGT]  's speech in Danang  Vietnam  to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  a forum that promotes free trade throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
  [TGT]  's speech to the body was billed to outline the administration's overall strategy toward what the administration now calls a ""free and open Indo-Pacific.""
The heart of  the speech   however  was a full-throated appeal to economic nationalism  in which the U.S. was ""going to focus on its own interests "" says Medeiros.
That stood in stark contrast with the announcement on APEC's sidelines by 11 member countries that they plan to persist with the Trans Pacific Partnership â a multilateral trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration that   [TGT]   walked out of on   [TGT]   third day in office.

5256,Trump personally asked Xi Jinping to help resolve case of UCLA basketball players arrested in China,Trump,"MANILA â President Trump  acknowledged Tuesday that  he  personally asked  his  Chinese counterpart  Xi Jinping  to help resolve the case of three UCLA men's basketball players who were arrested for shoplifting while in Hangzhou for a tournament last week.
âTheyâre working on it right now â  Trump  told reporters in reference to Chinese authorities as he prepared to return to Washington after a nearly two-week trip in Asia.  Trump  added that  he  hoped the detained players could be on their way home soon.
""Hopefully everything is going to work out ""  Trump  said.
 Trump  raised the arrests during a two-day state visit to Beijing  arriving a day after the three freshman players were accused of stealing sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store next to the team's hotel  according to people familiar with the conversation. Guard LiAngelo Ball  brother of Los Angeles Lakers rookie guard Lonzo Ball  and forwards Cody Riley and Jalen Hill did not play in the team's victory over Georgia Tech on Saturday in Shanghai. They did not fly home with the team  and ESPN has reported that authorities have surveillance footage and that the players could be required to remain in Hangzhou for a week or two.
After  Trump  raised the matter  Xi promised to look into the case and ensure that the players are treated fairly and expeditiously  said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Chief of Staff John F. Kelly has been in touch with the families of the players and has spoken with UCLA Coach Steve Alford  and Kelly remains in contact with Chinese authorities  the official added. This official indicated that charges against the players have been reduced and that the case is proceeding toward a resolution.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in an email that  Trump  raised the matter with Xi. On Tuesday   Trump  told reporters in Manila that  he  indeed spoke with Xi about the case. Xi has âbeen terrific â  Trump  said.

President Trump  announced Tuesday afternoon that  he  has signed a memorandum directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations to ban âbump stocksâ and other devices that turn semiautomatic firearms into âmachine guns.â
The device was used by the shooter who opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas in October  killing dozens and immediately prompting calls for lawmakers or the administration to ban such devices through legislation or regulations. At the time  the White House and the National Rifle Association made clear that they were open to the idea.

As gun-control issues are once again being discussed nationally  following a mass shooting at a high school in Florida last week  Trump was pushed to act.
On Tuesday   Trump  referred to the shooting last week as an âevil massacreâ and said  his  administration is âworking very hard to make sense of these events.â

Still  I never would have imagined that an act of mass violence allegedly committed by a man from Uzbekistan would spur me to go on the defensive for Africans. But itâs Trumpâs America  so anything is possible  I guess.
Sayfullo Saipov  an Uzbekistan national  is accused of killing eight and injuring 11 by plowing a pickup truck through a crowd of people in Manhattan. He came to the United States in 2010 on a diversity visa.  President Trump  tweeted  âThe terrorist came into our country through what is called the âDiversity Visa Lottery Program â a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based.â
The diversity lottery  more commonly known until recently as the green-card lottery  was created in 1990 to give an edge to underrepresented European countries in the immigration process. Since its inception though  the diversity lottery has become more often used by Africans seeking ways to enter the United States. Between 1994 and 2015  Africans accounted for more than 415 000 immigrants to the United States on the diversity visa program. According to the Pew Research foundation  in 2015  Ghana was the country with the highest number of applications (about 1.7 million) for the diversity visa lottery program. As a daughter of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants  I have friends and family who have benefited from the diversity visa lottery system.  Trump  could stand to learn a little bit about Ghanaians and our âmeritâ here in the States.
It was a son of a Ghanaian immigrants who made news earlier this year for  his  acceptance into all eight of the Ivy league schools. Ghanaian British designer David Adjaye was the architectural genius who designed the National Museum of African American history. Remember Freddy Adu  the young soccer phenom of the early aughts? His mother came to the United States on a diversity visa from Ghana.

Still  I never would have imagined that an act of mass violence allegedly committed by a man from Uzbekistan would spur me to go on the defensive for Africans. But itâs Trumpâs America  so anything is possible  I guess.
Sayfullo Saipov  an Uzbekistan national  is accused of killing eight and injuring 11 by plowing a pickup truck through a crowd of people in Manhattan. He came to the United States in 2010 on a diversity visa.   [TGT] tweeted  âThe terrorist came into our country through what is called the âDiversity Visa Lottery Program â a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based.â
The diversity lottery  more commonly known until recently as the green-card lottery  was created in 1990 to give an edge to underrepresented European countries in the immigration process. Since its inception though  the diversity lottery has become more often used by Africans seeking ways to enter the United States. Between 1994 and 2015  Africans accounted for more than 415 000 immigrants to the United States on the diversity visa program. According to the Pew Research foundation  in 2015  Ghana was the country with the highest number of applications (about 1.7 million) for the diversity visa lottery program. As a daughter of Ghanaian and Nigerian immigrants  I have friends and family who have benefited from the diversity visa lottery system.   [TGT] could stand to learn a little bit about Ghanaians and our âmeritâ here in the States.
It was a son of a Ghanaian immigrants who made news earlier this year for   [TGT]   acceptance into all eight of the Ivy league schools. Ghanaian British designer David Adjaye was the architectural genius who designed the National Museum of African American history. Remember Freddy Adu  the young soccer phenom of the early aughts? His mother came to the United States on a diversity visa from Ghana.

5262,Prime Minister Tell Trump Heâs Not Welcome in Britain,Trump,"Mr. Trump  only compounded the affront by telling the prime minister â again in a tweet â not to âfocus on me  focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!â
Iâm sure you are   Mr. Trump . But that is not the response of a friend. It is the dismissive taunt of the worldâs most overpromoted playground bully.
As it happens  I came to the conclusion that Mr. Trumpâs visit should be canceled in August  after the violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville  Va. When the most powerful person in the world fails the simplest test of democratic leadership â answering the question âWere the Nazis uniquely bad?â â the whole world is involved. The president failed that test conspicuously and gave comfort to the loathsome âidentitarianismâ that understands society as a competition between races  tribes and religion.
Groups like Britain First and their counterparts across Europe were inspired by Mr. Trumpâs refusal to single out for condemnation the white supremacists; they understood his reticence to be a wink of recognition. Now the wink has escalated into something close to outright endorsement.
In February  members of Parliament debated a petition signed by more than 1.8 million people objecting to  Mr. Trumpâs state visit . They were told by  Mrs. Mayâs  ministerial colleagues that Britainâs diplomatic  strategic and commercial interests must override distaste for the American presidentâs racism  misogyny and offhand bigotry.","[TGT] only compounded the affront by telling the prime minister â again in a tweet â not to âfocus on me  focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom.

5263,Prospect Of U.S. Embassy Move To Jerusalem Worries Leaders In Middle East And Beyond : Parallels : NPR,Trump,"President Trump  appears poised to overturn decades of U.S. policy on one of the world's most delicate geopolitical spots: Jerusalem.
 Trump  phoned Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas Tuesday and notified him about his ""intention"" to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem  according to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA.
A Palestinian official told  NPR Trump  did not clarify when such a move would take place but promised Abbas he would soon present a proposal for Israeli-Palestinian peace.
The White House says  Trump  will announce  his  decision on the embassy's location in the coming days.
 Trump 's evangelical and pro-Israel supporters have been pushing him to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem  symbolically endorsing Israel's control over parts of the city that Israel captured in 1967 and that Palestinians demand for a future capital.
The  Trump  administration has said the question of moving the embassy was not a matter of if  but when.
If  Trump  moves forward on  his  vow  it will be a major reversal of long-standing U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. has long said the status of Jerusalem should be resolved in peace talks. No country in the world bases its embassy in the city  to avoid taking sides.
Successive American presidents have signed waivers deferring a congressional act calling for the embassy to be moved.  Trump  signed such a waiver in June  saying  he  wanted to give U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts a chance to succeed.
But in recent days  U.S. officials indicated  Trump  was considering moving the embassy or announcing formal U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

5266,Trump Recertifies Iran Nuclear Deal but Only Reluctantly,Trump,"WASHINGTON â  President Trump  agreed on Monday to certify again that Iran is complying with an international nuclear agreement that  he  has strongly criticized  but only after hours of arguing with  his  top national security advisers  briefly upending a planned announcement as a legal deadline loomed.
 Mr. Trump  has repeatedly condemned the deal brokered by President Barack Obama as a dangerous capitulation to Iran  but six months into  his  presidency  he  has not abandoned it. The decision on Monday was the second time  his  administration certified Iranâs compliance  and aides said  a frustrated Mr. Trump  had told  his  security team that  he  would not keep doing so indefinitely.
Administration officials announced the certification on Monday evening while emphasizing that they intended to toughen enforcement of the deal  apply new sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism and other destabilizing activities  and negotiate with European partners to craft a broader strategy to increase pressure on Tehran. Aides said  Mr. Trump  had insisted on such actions before agreeing to the consensus recommendation of  his  national security team.
â The president  has made very clear that  he  thought this was a bad deal â a bad deal for the United States â Sean Spicer  the White House press secretary  told reporters at a briefing on Monday before the decision was made.
At an hourlong meeting last Wednesday  all of  the presidentâs  major security advisers recommended  he  preserve the Iran deal for now. Among those who spoke out were Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster  the national security adviser; and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr.  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  according to an official who described internal discussions on the condition of anonymity. The official said  Mr. Trump  had spent 55 minutes of the meeting telling them  he  did not want to.
 Mr. Trump  did not want to certify Iranâs compliance the first time around either  but was talked into it on the condition that  his  team come back with a new strategy to confront Tehran  the official said. Last week  advisers told the president they needed more time to work with allies and Congress.  Mr. Trump  responded that before  he  would go along  they had to meet certain conditions  said the official  who would not outline what the conditions were.
While  Mr. Trump  headed to Paris and then spent the weekend in New Jersey   his  team developed a strategy that it hoped would satisfy  him  and planned to notify Congress and make the case publicly on Monday. But even as allies were quietly being informed   Mr. Trump  balked when  he  heard the plan at  his  morning security briefing  the official said. The argument continued during a separate meeting with Mr. Tillerson as  Mr. Trump  pressed for more action  the official said.
Suddenly  a background briefing to announce the decision was postponed and Mr. Spicer was sent out to assure reporters that a decision would be coming âvery shortly â while aides scrambled to satisfy  Mr. Trump .  He  agreed only late in the day after a final meeting in the Oval Office  in effect telling  his  advisers that  he  was giving them another chance and this time they had to deliver. The announcement was then rescheduled for the early evening and a notice was sent to Congress to continue withholding nuclear-related sanctions against Iran.
That Mr. Trumpâs actions will satisfy conservatives who have been urging him to rip up the Iran deal seemed unlikely. In a column in The Hill  a Capitol Hill newspaper  John R. Bolton  a former ambassador to the United Nations who has interviewed with the president for several jobs in the administration  argued that the nuclear agreement âremains palpably harmful to American national interests.â Withdrawing from it  he said  âshould be the highest priority.â
Israel and its supporters in Washington have also bristled at a new cease-fire in southwest Syria that was brokered by  Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia   fearing it will leave Iran as a major player on the ground in the six-year civil war. Mr. Spicer said the administration would address that with Israel. âThereâs a shared interest that we have with Israel  making sure that Iran does not gain a foothold  military base-wise  in southern Syria â Mr. Spicer said.
Tehranâs clerical government argues that  Mr. Trump  has already violated the nuclear agreement by pressuring businesses not to engage with Iran even though the nuclear sanctions have been lifted. âThat is violation of not the spirit but of the letter of the J.C.P.O.A. of the nuclear deal â Mohammad Javad Zarif  Iranâs foreign minister  said on CNNâs âFareed Zakaria GPSâ on Sunday  using the initials for the agreement.
Mr. Zarif  visiting New York  told a gathering of the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday that  he has yet to talk with Mr. Tillerson  unlike his frequent conversations with former Secretary of State John Kerry  with whom he negotiated the nuclear accord .
That would be an outcome welcomed by  the Trump administration . Top officials like Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis have expressed concern about the effect on American relations with European allies if  Mr. Trump  were to unilaterally pull out  especially after  he  already announced  his  intention to back out of the Paris climate change accord that Europeans strongly support.
 Mr. Trump  has aligned the United States with Sunni Arab states  like Saudi Arabia  as well as Israel in their mutual struggle with Shiite-led Iran over control of the Middle East.  His  administration has already announced modest new sanctions against Iran  but nothing on the scale of those imposed before the nuclear agreement.","WASHINGTON â   [TGT] agreed on Monday to certify again that Iran is complying with an international nuclear agreement that   [TGT]   has strongly criticized  but only after hours of arguing with   [TGT]   top national security advisers  briefly upending a planned announcement as a legal deadline loomed.

5268,The Latest: Palestinians lightly wounded in clashes,Donald Trump,"JERUSALEM (AP) â The Latest on the fallout from President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital (all times local):
Clashes broke out Thursday between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters following  U.S. President Donald Trump 's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
 Trump 's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem  captured by Israel in 1967  as a future capital.
An Israeli city plans to name a park after U.S. President Donald Trump in honor of his decision to declare Jerusalem the capital of Israel and move the embassy there.
David Even Zur  the mayor of the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Yam  calls  Trump 's move ""historic."" He says it was ""a brave  unprecedented step which none of his predecessors were prepared to do.""

Clashes broke out Thursday between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters following  U.S. President Donald Trump 's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
  [TGT]  's dramatic break on Wednesday with decades of U.S. policy on Jerusalem counters long-standing international assurances to the Palestinians that the fate of the city will be determined in negotiations. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem  captured by Israel in 1967  as a future capital.

5269,The dilemma of development: Will Obama center hurt those it's supposed to help?,Barack Obama,"A commander in chief turned salesman in chief   Barack Obama  painted a rosy picture Tuesday of  his  planned presidential centerâs urban impact.
 He  described a transformed neighborhood  with visitors checking out a restaurant or an art studio across Stony Island Avenue from the center. Yet  Obama  also revealed  his  pragmatic side  promising the center would supercharge areas hit by decades of disinvestment  while acknowledging fears that such growth will force out low-income residents.
âYou canât have one without the other â  he  said.
Displacement of low-income people caused by well-intentioned public works is one of the most vexing urban-planning problems of our time. In 2016  a year after The 606 brought a sliver of much-needed open space to Chicagoâs Northwest Side  residents marched to draw attention to families being squeezed out of their homes because of increasing property taxes and rising rents in Logan Square  one of the neighborhoods along the bike and pedestrian path. Even businesspeople who support putting the privately funded  Obama  center in historic Jackson Park express concern that the 19-acre complex will push out the poor â the very kind of people for whom  Obama  advocated as a young community organizer.
âWe need activity in the area â said Ghana native and dress designer Sarah Kuenyefu-Searcy  whose store at 1510 E. 63rd St.  just west of the centerâs site  sells clothing influenced by her African heritage. But throughout the storeâs Woodlawn neighborhood  she added  âpeople are definitely worried about rents going up and being displaced.â Some residents are voicing similar concerns in South Shore and Washington Park  the other areas most likely to be affected by the  Obama  center.
Achieving this balance  between growth and the interests of nearby residents  will be a high-wire act  one whose outcome will be as significant for Chicago as the difficult and still-unresolved task of placing the  Obama  center in the historic landscape of Jackson Park. Both aspects of the center still need work.

5270,Trump's 'go,Trump,"Trump's 'go-yuuuuge' 'in-their-face' DACA deal
President Trump's proposed deal with the Democrats on legalizing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients in exchange for a border wall  an end to the visa lottery  and an end to chain migration  is drawing some cautions from the right  as Ed Straker's piece on radio host Mark Levin's thoughts shows. But I think another radio host  Bill Mitchell  paints what's going on better. Far from this being a classic Republican cave-in  the DACA proposal probably a clever Trumpian deal to outsmart the Democrats and leave them out on their ear. After all  while ending illegal immigration and restoring rule of law is important to conservatives  it's not going to be easy to throw every DACA recipient out. Some after all are valedictorians  and Americans have no stomach for throwing them back to the s-holes. So there is  Trump 's deal and  it  might benefit all sides  including Republicans.
For one thing  it's bigger than anything the Democrats have laid out - citizenship for 1.8 million DACA and wannabe DACA recipients after a dozen years  which is about the same time as the immigration line for a green card  meaning it doesn't stiff those waiting legally. Democrats must feel like they have been playing smallball compared to this  and of course Republicans will benefit at least slightly.  Trump  has taken the lead and stolen  their  thunder. Here's what Mitchell wrote on Twitter: Remember   Trump 's broader stated goal is ""merit-based"" immigration. His new ""DACA deal"" is just that. He brings the illegals out of the shadows by registering them. They screw up once  they're gone. He just added a ""merit-based"" filter to illegal immigration. Smart. â Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) January 26  2018
and A path to citizenship under  Trump 's plan would take 12 long years. During that time  ""Dreamers"" must be PERFECT or they get deported. In the end  the only ones left to achieve citizenship are here on ""merit"" and will likely vote Republican because they will be prosperous. â Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) January 26  2018
It makes sense because studies show that most Dreamers are underachievers  many of whom are just high school graduates  heavy welfare users  have petty crime backgrounds  and do not speak English. It's almost a given that most won't make it to the twelve-year finish line without getting into a bar fight  getting caught graffiti-spraying  or be picked up for drunk driving. The only ones who make it will be those with a work ethic and family values. Those actually are the ones who could become Republicans in the long run.  Trump  knows this. Democrats don't. They believe their own propaganda about all DREAMers being valedictorians. All it would take is the course of time for the sheep to sort themselves out from the goats and then we'd see. At the end  we would get the creme de la creme  and based on their values  not on the things Democrats value  such as class or skin color  just values.  Trump 's DACA twelve-year test is for them to have a chance to show their values  kind of like Hercules being asked to perform the twelve labors. In the end  we'd get the people who would actually like being Americans and succeed at it. We wouldn't have to keep the goats. The goats would go back to Mexico  or wherever. It's not foolproof  of course. All it takes is one leftwing judge to vacate a conviction on account of the consequences for a DACA recipient's citizenship prospects  nullifying the entire incentive to be good. What's more  as Levin points out  another president can ease the time requirements to nothing  and if he is a Democrat  he will. Also  it's a stretch to say that if DACA recipients get prosperous they'll vote conservative. Has Mitchell been to any big cities lately? But it's a gamble a lot of us can live with. It also has political advantages.  Trump  can be the champion of DACA  not Nancy Pelosi  and then where would Democrats be?  He 'd have stolen their thunder. Mitchell thinks it's political  too. Democrats do not want amnesty for DACA recipients. They want #IdentityPolitics as a campaign issue for 11/18.  Trump  gets that and is denying them what they really want. Think strategic. #RedTsunami2018. â Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) January 26  2018
and If Democrats accept  Trump 's DACA deal they alienate their far left base by caving on the wall. If they reject  the deal   they alienate everyone else by being #AmericaLast. By sweetening a deal Democrat leadership CANNOT accept  he completely marginalizes them for 11/18. Get it? â Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii) January 26  2018
Realistically  after all we have seen of  Trump  in the last year  would  he  really botch it?  He ' rolled Democrats every time they got near  him . This tweet from a thoughtful Washington operative  seems to state it best: Dear liberals:
 He  bested you in the electoral college  passed a tax cut without you  turned the shutdown against you  and repealed your beloved health care mandate.
 He 's unraveling your gains on judges  welfare  and regulation.

5272,Former U.S. Ambassador To Russia On How Trump 's Policies Compare To Obama's : NPR,Trump,"Former U.S. Ambassador To Russia On How  Trump 's Policies Compare To Obama's
NPR's Mary Louise Kelly speaks with former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul about  President Trump 's stance on Russia and how that compares with policies throughout the Obama administration.
And we're going to take a moment now to fact-check a claim on Russia.  President Trump  on Tuesday tweeted this - quote  ""I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama. Just look at the facts."" Well  we're going to do just that  and we have asked Michael McFaul to help us out. He was the American ambassador to Russia under President Obama  and he's now a professor at Stanford from where he joins me now.
KELLY: I should start by acknowledging the obvious  which is that you're not a neutral observer in this having served in the Obama administration. But you have deep and firsthand knowledge  which is valuable here. So I want to start with asking just what's your gut reaction to that statement from  President Trump  - that  he  has been tougher on Russia than Obama?
MCFAUL: Well  my gut reaction is that - and this is going to offend everybody in the Obama camp and the  Trump  camp - is that I actually see more continuity between President Obama's policy on Russia and Trump's policy on Russia than most other people do.
KELLY: Now since  Trump  assumed the presidency  Congress has passed a new sanctions bill  which so far the  Trump  administration has chosen not to enforce. They haven't announced new sanctions  at least so far. And they've been criticized for that by Republicans and Democrats who say this shows that  President Trump  is soft on Russia. What do you think?
KELLY:  President Trump  has not  himself  called out Russia  but officials who serve  him  do.  His  national security adviser H.R. McMaster just did  for example. Do you see a disconnect between what  the president  says and what  his  administration actually does when it comes to Russia?
MCFAUL: I think there's a fundamental disconnect. I was in the audience with H.R. McMaster in Munich when  he  made those remarks. Not only do many of  his  senior officials say things differently - tougher on Russia - but the policy is tougher. But when it comes to  the president   for whatever reason   he  never criticizes Vladimir Putin for the things  he 's done ever. And it's I think a big disconnect between the rhetoric of  the president himself  and the policy of the Trump administration more generally.
KELLY: Before I let you go  what is the end goal with Russia? I mean  when we speak of a president - whether it's President Trump  President Obama - getting tough on Russia  that's in the service of what?
MCFAUL: And I think this is another place where  President Trump  is sometimes confused. I think  he  gets mixed up in  his  head the difference between means and ends. The means could be engagement  getting tough  isolating. But the ends have to be things very concrete - things like  we would like to see Russia leave Eastern Ukraine. We would like to see Russia stop interfering in our electoral politics. Those are very concrete objectives - American national security objectives. The means may change over time depending on what the issue is  and that's the tough or not get tough. But to have a  quote  unquote  ""good relationship"" with Russia or Putin or any country for that matter  I think is always the incorrect way to think about American national security policy and American foreign policy.","Former U.S. Ambassador To Russia On How  Trump 's Policies Compare To Obama's

After the White House staff secretary  Rob Porter  resigned in the face of accusations that he had abused his two former wives   President Trump  tweeted in defense of people whose âlives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.â
âSome are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new â  he  wrote on Saturday. âThere is no recovery for someone falsely accused â life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?â
The Twitter post was in line with a general pattern: Since  he  became the Republican presidential nominee in 2016   Mr. Trump  has defended several men accused of sexual misconduct  including  himself .
Even before becoming a politician   Mr. Trump  weighed in on allegations against well-known men  though  he  did not always side with the accused.
Here is a history of  the presidentâs  responses to sexual misconduct and abuse allegations.
The allegations  which Mr. Porter denied  were reportedly known to some people in the White House  including John F. Kelly  the presidentâs chief of staff. But  Mr. Trump  praised Mr. Porter when asked about him on Friday. â He  worked very hard â  the president  said  adding that  he  was surprised by the allegations.
â He  did a very good job when  he  was in the White House  and we hope  he  has a wonderful career  and  he  will have a great career ahead of  him  â  he  said. âBut it was very sad when we heard about it  and certainly  he âs also very sad now.â
In November   Mr. Trump  defended Roy S. Moore  the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama  who had been accused of sexually assaulting and preying on teenage girls.
âHe totally denies it â  Mr. Trump  said of Mr. Moore in November. âHe says it didnât happen. You have to listen to him  also.â

After the White House staff secretary  Rob Porter  resigned in the face of accusations that he had abused his two former wives   President Trump  tweeted in defense of people whose âlives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.â
âSome are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new â  he  wrote on Saturday. âThere is no recovery for someone falsely accused â life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?â
The Twitter post was in line with a general pattern: Since  he  became the Republican presidential nominee in 2016    [TGT] has defended several men accused of sexual misconduct  including   [TGT]  .
Even before becoming a politician    [TGT] weighed in on allegations against well-known men  though   [TGT]   did not always side with the accused.
Here is a history of  the presidentâs  responses to sexual misconduct and abuse allegations.
The allegations  which Mr. Porter denied  were reportedly known to some people in the White House  including John F. Kelly  the presidentâs chief of staff. But   [TGT] praised Mr. Porter when asked about him on Friday. â He  worked very hard â  the president  said  adding that  he  was surprised by the allegations.
â He  did a very good job when  he  was in the White House  and we hope  he  has a wonderful career  and  he  will have a great career ahead of  him  â  he  said. âBut it was very sad when we heard about it  and certainly  he âs also very sad now.â
In November    [TGT] defended Roy S. Moore  the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama  who had been accused of sexually assaulting and preying on teenage girls.
âHe totally denies it â   [TGT] said of Mr. Moore in November. âHe says it didnât happen. You have to listen to him  also.â

5275,Should liberal media trust Michael Wolffâs explosive anti,Trump,"Excerpts from Michael Wolffâs explosive upcoming book  âFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House â hit various websites this week  sending the mainstream media into a tizzy with endless tidbits that paint President Trump in an unflattering fashion despite clear signs that not everything in it may be accurate.
Wolff has developed a reputation as someone capable of exaggerating the truth  but he also is a world-class writer who managed to obtain unprecedented access to the Trump White House. The result is a product that is too juicy for the mainstream media to ignore  even if some of it may be fictitious. In fact  the bookâs release date was moved up because of the anticipation.
The liberal media are eating up the salacious details and CNNâs Alisyn Camerota even pressed Trumpâs friend  Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy  on whether the president eats cheeseburgers in bed â one of the unflattering details Wolff wrote.
Blake pointed out  âWolff has taken  some of the most gossiped-about aspects of the Trump White House  and put  them  forward as fact â often plainly stated fact without even anonymous sources cited.â

âThey just donât care whether itâs accurate as long as  it attacks Trump .

âImagine Obama being treated with the same journalistic strategy where every little hyped nugget of information becomes national news. It would have crushed his every initiative  which is what the press is trying to do with  Trump  â he added.
One passage of the controversial book was quickly debunked  as Wolff alleged that  Trump  didnât know who former House Speaker John Boehner was when he was suggested as a chief of staff candidate.
âWhoâs that?â  Trump  replied  according to Wolff.
Well  Twitter sleuths quickly pointed out that  Trump  had tweeted about Boehner several times over the years in addition to name-dropping him on the campaign trail.  Trump  and Boehner even played golf together in 2013. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called the claim that  Trump  didnât know who Boehner was âridiculousâ during Thursdayâs press briefing  but she didnât stop there.
 Trumpâs legal team  has agreed with Sanders  as  it  sent a letter to both the publisher and Wolff on Thursday demanding they immediately stop  its  publication.  It  also demanded âa full and complete retraction and apology.â

5276,What Old Depositions Say About Trump Talking to Mueller,Trump,"Sometime soon   President Trump  is likely to be deposed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and  his  team. Several outlets  beginning with NBC News on Monday  report that  Trump âs lawyers are negotiating with Mueller about  the president  testifying under oath  though Mueller has made no formal request so far. The specific importance of such a deposition is hard to judge.  Trump âs lawyers  who also appear to have leaked word of the discussions to the press  present it as a sign that Mueller is nearing the end of his investigation  though they have previously  and incorrectly  predicted the probe would be over by Thanksgiving or Christmas. The New York Times reports that Mueller seems interested in topics that would imply more of a focus on the possibility of obstruction of justice than on collusion with Russia during the campaign  but that is somewhat speculative. Related Story The Art of the Swindle Assuming the deposition occurs   Trump  will make political history as only the fifth sitting president to be deposed  following in the footsteps of Ulysses Grant  Gerald Ford  Jimmy Carter  and  most consequentially Bill Clintonâwhose lie about not having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky in a 1998 deposition led to his impeachment. For  Trump   however  depositions are familiar territory. In 2012  he said during a deposition that he had done more than 100 over the course of his career. Transcripts  and in one case video  of three depositions taken over the last decade provide a fascinating look into how the prolifically dissembling president behaves when he is under oath.  The Donald Trump who emerges from these depositions  is the same but different from the one familiar to Americans today.  He  is just as apt to bluster and braggadocio  and sometimes peevish. But within the confines of conference rooms and offices   he  is calmer  more restrained  and more deliberate than  his  public persona  and with the tether of  his  oath holding  him  back  often acknowledges when  he  is wrong or has misrepresented things in the past.
 Trumpâs  tendency toward inflating thingsâhis net worth  his intellectual prowess  his actionsâhas become a defining characteristic of his career in politics  as it was in his career in business. Fact-checkers have made tallying the lies and untruths that the president delivers nearly a competitive sport. As a result  itâs striking to see  Trump  in a setting where  he  is obliged to tell the truth  under penalty of law. For example   Trump  is involved in litigation against Geoffrey Zakarian  a chef who had signed a lease to open a restaurant in  Trumpâs  hotel in D.C.  but pulled out in response to inflammatory comments that  Trump  made as a presidential candidate. During the deposition  an attorney read  Trump  a document boasting  â Mr. Trump  is personally involved in everything that  his  name represents. This commitment has made  him  the preeminent developer of quality real estate known around the world  and in all  his  endeavors the  Trump  gold standard is apparent.â Is that true  she asked?  Trump : Yes. Q: And when it says that youâre personally involved in everything that your name represents  what does that mean  that your name represents?  Trump : Well  I think that  you know  I do things that donât necessarily have my name on it. But Iâm involved with  when we put our name on a hotel such as this one which is very important  Iâm very much involved in the details. In fact  that was not true  as  Trump  acknowledged a few minutes later: Q: Did you review the lease at all before you signed it? Trump: No. Q: So did you have any understanding when you signed the lease as to what your rights were relative to getting damages against the tenant in the event of a default by the tenant?  Trump : No. When I signed the lease  you know  my son said we have the lease  so I signed the lease. But  really  they knew it much better than I did. I wasnât involved in the lease. I signed it  but I wasnât involved in it. He added  âI signed hundreds  much more than that. But I donât generally review them. I have somebody thatâwhether itâs an executive or in this case one of my children  you know  I rely on people to do these things. Including lawyers that Iâve had for many years  like [ Trump  Organization general counsel Alan] Garten or somebody. So I relyâso I very rarely get too involved in it.â
When he was caught exaggerating the speed of completion of the hotel project   Trump  simply pretended  he  hadnât. âWeâre substantially ahead of schedule â  he  insisted  even as the lawyer asked (and received an answer) to a question about when the timeline for opening had moved back from 2015 to 2016. As The Washington Post noted in a 2016 piece  Trumpâs tendency to back off  his  most obviously fake statements was especially pronounced in a December 2007 deposition.  Trump  had sued the journalist and author Tim OâBrien  who had written a book saying  Trumpâs  net worth was far less than the billions  he  claimed.  Trump  sued OâBrien for libel and defamation. The Post found 30 occasions in that deposition alone where  Trump  admitted to making false statements. This being Trump  the acolyte of âtruthful hyperbole â  he  couldnât let go entirely. Instead   he  found repeated ways to explain  his  untruths. Why had  he  claimed to own 50 percent of a business when  he  only owned 30? Because  Trump  hadnât had to put up cash upfront   he  said  âthe 30 percent equates to much more than 30 percent.â Why had  Trump  claimed to have been paid $1 million for a speech when  as  he  acknowledged under oath   he âd actually received $400 000?  He  had decided that the value to  his  brand made up another 600 grand. Was it true that  Trump  had not received any loans from  his  father  as heâd told OâBrien? Under oath  he offered a different story: âI think a small amount a long time ago. I think it was like in the $9 million range.â Why had he inflated his net worth? The reason  he said  was that it varied  and just not with the market. âMy net worth fluctuates  and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings  even my own feelings â  Trump  said.
 Trump  had an explanation that would telegraph  his  approach when  he  later decided to run for president: âIâm no different from a politician running for office. You always want to put the best foot forward.â Yet at other times   Trump  simply conceded  he âd been wrong. Faced with a public statement that membership at a golf course had cost $300 000  50 percent higher than the real figureâas a Trump Organization document stated. â Correct â Trump  said.  He  also excused errors in a book published under  his  name  saying  âI read it very quickly â even though  he  was credited as author.  Trumpâs  suit against OâBrien was dismissed. The rare aptitude for honesty is not the only thing  thatâs  notable about  Trumpâs  demeanor in depositions. In most cases  videos of  his  appearances are not available. In a suit over  Trump University   for example  transcripts of two depositions were released  but Judge Gonzalo Curiel (yes  the one  Trump  said was biased against  him  because of  his  Mexican heritage) blocked the release of the videos. But in the Trump Hotel case  videos were released. They show a  Trump  who is calm and deliberate  and while  his  speaking style is recognizable   he  seems to take  his  time and consider answers and thoughts far more carefully than  he  does in public appearances. This is not the only case where this public-private split happens; as I noted last year  when  transcripts of Trumpâs conversations with world leaders  leaked   they  revealed a far more articulate leader than the public President Trump.
This is not to say that  he âs happyâfew people enjoy depositions. For the first half of the Trump Hotel deposition   Trump  sits with  his  arms crossed  looking cross. In other cases   he  is even more querulous. During the  Trump University  deposition   Trump  was angry from the start  accusing the opposing counsel of âharassmentâ when  she  asked  him  to spell  his  name. âI think the lawsuit is trying to hurt the brand  and I honestly look forward to winning this case and suing your law firm for as much as we can sue them for  and we will be doing that â  he  said. Later   he  scolded the lawyer as  she  handed him documents. âCould you not lick your finger before you give me a document  please. Would that be okay?â  Trump  said. âItâs disgusting.â In a 2011 deposition   he  blew up when a lawyer asked to take time to pump breastmilk. âYouâre disgusting â  he  said  and walked out. Some of  his  irritability may represent a strategic choice. In the  Trump University  deposition in particular   Trumpâs  lawyer repeatedly tangles with the deposing lawyer  objecting to lines of questioning and eventually calling for a break to call the judge to discuss whether certain subjects were permitted. But  Trump  seems to get in on the act  too.  He  often acts aggrieved about certain lines of questioning or treats the opposing lawyers as though their questions are preposterous.  He  also repeatedly goes on tangents  bragging about the value of  his  business or about  his  political success or whatever else might strike  his  fancy  even as  he  accuses opposing counsel of filibustering. These techniques for running out the clock  as well as the penchant for projection  will be familiar to anyone who watched  Trump  debate in 2015 or 2016.
If there is one tendency that emerges from the depositions that might have bearing on Muellerâs probe  itâs that  Trump  demonstrates little involvement in or awareness of whatâs going on at  his  business. It helps that  Trump  claims to have done practically no preparation for  the Trump University  and Trump Hotel depositions. (Former: âHow did you prepare for your deposition?â âI didn't prepare.â Latter: âI would say virtually nothing. I spoke with my counsel for a short period of time.â) Over and over  though  he shows himself to be disconnected from the administration of his business empire. Itâs not just his statement on the hotel restaurant  that âI wasnât involved in the lease. I signed it  but I wasnât involved in it.â Asked what his responsibilities with regard to  Trump University  were   Trump  offered a gauzily meaningless statement: âWell  it was very important to me  because if I can impart knowledge to people to make their lives better  that is a very important thing to me.â Confronted with his lawyerâs statement saying that  Trump  did not have âsubstantial controlâ of  Trump University    Trump  tried to find a way to have it both ways. âSo I thought it was aâI thought it was a veryâso it was a very important thing to me  actually  the school â  he  said. But  Trump  clearly had little knowledge of how  Trump University  ran.  He  insisted  he  had reviewed resumes of teachers  but couldnât remember many of their names  how they were chosen  or what they taught.  He  could not explain what students received in the apprentice or Gold Elite programs.  He  did not recall receiving a letter from the New York Department of Education demanding that  the company  drop the âuniversityâ moniker. Asked whether  he âd reviewed an agreement   he  replied  âProbably. I mean  I have lawyers that do this. I donât think I did it  but I have lawyers that do it  yes.â  He  couldnât recall whether  he  owned certain business entities and deferred questions to  his  lawyer. âI donât know. Youâd have to ask Mr. Garten. It could be. I think so  but I just donât know specifically  but you could ask Mr. Garten â he said.","Sometime soon    [TGT] is likely to be deposed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and  his  team.

Instead   he  found repeated ways to explain  his  untruths. Why had  he  claimed to own 50 percent of a business when  he  only owned 30? Because   [TGT]    [TGT]  had to put up cash upfront   he  said  âthe 30 percent equates to much more than 30 percent.â Why had   [TGT]   claimed to have been paid $1 million for a speech when  as   [TGT]   acknowledged under oath    [TGT]  âd actually received $400 000?   [TGT]   had decided that the value to   [TGT]   brand made up another 600 grand. Was it true that   [TGT] had not received any loans from   [TGT]   father  as heâd told OâBrien? Under oath  he offered a different story: âI think a small amount a long time ago. I think it was like in the $9 million range.â Why had he inflated his net worth? The reason  he said  was that it varied  and just not with the market. âMy net worth fluctuates  and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings  even my own feelings â   [TGT] said.
  [TGT] had an explanation that would telegraph   [TGT]   approach when   [TGT]   later decided to run for president: âIâm no different from a politician running for office. You always want to put the best foot forward.â Yet at other times    [TGT] simply conceded   [TGT]  âd been wrong. Faced with a public statement that membership at a golf course had cost $300 000  50 percent higher than the real figureâas a Trump Organization document stated. â Correct â  [TGT] said.   [TGT]   also excused errors in a book published under   [TGT]   name  saying  âI read it very quickly â even though  he  was credited as author.   [TGT] suit against OâBrien was dismissed. The rare aptitude for honesty is not the only thing  thatâs  notable about  Trumpâs  demeanor in depositions. In most cases  videos of  his  appearances are not available. In a suit over   [TGT]    for example  transcripts of two depositions were released  but Judge Gonzalo Curiel (yes  the one   [TGT] said was biased against   [TGT]   because of   [TGT]   Mexican heritage) blocked the release of the videos. But in the Trump Hotel case  videos were released. They show a  Trump  who is calm and deliberate  and while  his  speaking style is recognizable   he  seems to take  his  time and consider answers and thoughts far more carefully than  he  does in public appearances. This is not the only case where this public-private split happens; as I noted last year  when  transcripts of Trumpâs conversations with world leaders  leaked   they  revealed a far more articulate leader than the public President Trump.
This is not to say that  he âs happyâfew people enjoy depositions. For the first half of the Trump Hotel deposition    [TGT] sits with   [TGT]   arms crossed  looking cross. In other cases    [TGT]   is even more querulous. During the   [TGT]   deposition    [TGT] was angry from the start  accusing the opposing counsel of âharassmentâ when  she  asked  him  to spell  his  name. âI think the lawsuit is trying to hurt the brand  and I honestly look forward to winning this case and suing your law firm for as much as we can sue them for  and we will be doing that â  he  said. Later   he  scolded the lawyer as  she  handed him documents. âCould you not lick your finger before you give me a document  please. Would that be okay?â   [TGT] said. âItâs disgusting.â In a 2011 deposition   he  blew up when a lawyer asked to take time to pump breastmilk. âYouâre disgusting â  he  said  and walked out. Some of  his  irritability may represent a strategic choice. In the   [TGT]   deposition in particular    [TGT] lawyer repeatedly tangles with the deposing lawyer  objecting to lines of questioning and eventually calling for a break to call the judge to discuss whether certain subjects were permitted. But   [TGT] seems to get in on the act  too.   [TGT]   often acts aggrieved about certain lines of questioning or treats the opposing lawyers as though their questions are preposterous.   [TGT]   also repeatedly goes on tangents  bragging about the value of   [TGT]   business or about   [TGT]   political success or whatever else might strike   [TGT]   fancy  even as   [TGT]   accuses opposing counsel of filibustering. These techniques for running out the clock  as well as the penchant for projection  will be familiar to anyone who watched   [TGT]   debate in 2015 or 2016.
If there is one tendency that emerges from the depositions that might have bearing on Muellerâs probe  itâs that   [TGT]   demonstrates little involvement in or awareness of whatâs going on at  his  business. It helps that   [TGT] claims to have done practically no preparation for  the Trump University  and Trump Hotel depositions. (Former: âHow did you prepare for your deposition?â âI didn't prepare.â Latter: âI would say virtually nothing. I spoke with my counsel for a short period of time.â) Over and over  though  he shows himself to be disconnected from the administration of his business empire. Itâs not just his statement on the hotel restaurant  that âI wasnât involved in the lease. I signed it  but I wasnât involved in it.â Asked what his responsibilities with regard to   [TGT]   were    [TGT]   offered a gauzily meaningless statement: âWell  it was very important to me  because if I can impart knowledge to people to make their lives better  that is a very important thing to me.â Confronted with his lawyerâs statement saying that  Trump  did not have âsubstantial controlâ of   [TGT] tried to find a way to have it both ways. âSo I thought it was aâI thought it was a veryâso it was a very important thing to me  actually  the school â   [TGT]   said. But   [TGT]   clearly had little knowledge of how   [TGT]   ran.   [TGT]   insisted   [TGT]   had reviewed resumes of teachers  but couldnât remember many of their names  how they were chosen  or what they taught.   [TGT]   could not explain what students received in the apprentice or Gold Elite programs.   [TGT]   did not recall receiving a letter from the New York Department of Education demanding that  the company  drop the âuniversityâ moniker. Asked whether  he âd reviewed an agreement   he  replied  âProbably. I mean  I have lawyers that do this. I donât think I did it  but I have lawyers that do it  yes.â  He  couldnât recall whether  he  owned certain business entities and deferred questions to  his  lawyer. âI donât know. Youâd have to ask Mr. Garten. It could be. I think so  but I just donât know specifically  but you could ask Mr. Garten â he said.",Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,,,,,,,,,,

In the year since his election   Donald Trump  has changed Washington more than Washington has changed  him .
Instead   Trump  continues to be the unpredictable bludgeon familiar from the 2016 campaign. He has forced Washington to adjust to him â accelerating the pace  raising the temperature and widening the fractures in both parties. In short: louder  faster  fiercer.
âTrumpâs successors can draw lessons from his successful and lasting appeal to the white working class  his flamboyant verbal disparagement of establishment Washington  his attempt to diminish a hostile mainstream media and his strong use of executive powers â says political scientist Steven Schier  co-author of The  Trump  Presidency: An Outsider in the Oval Office. âAll this has converted the presidency into an engine of battle. Future presidents will no doubt fire up that engine for their own purposes.â
 Trump  has intensified and magnified these trends. Partisanship has been hardening for decades  and President Obama expanded the use of executive action when  he  wasnât able to push legislation through an opposition-led Congress. Trust in the news media and the government was eroding well before  Trump  began attacking those institutions on Twitter.
That said  Trumpâs disruptive impact on Washington has gone beyond what would have been imaginable in an administration led by Clinton or by any of  Trump 's rivals for the Republican nomination.
 He  has redefined the GOP in  his  image â no longer the party of free trade  global leadership and deficit reduction but of âAmerica Firstâ and cultural warfare. In a new book being published next week former president George W. Bush told author Mark Updegrove  âIâm worried that I will be the last Republican president.â
And  Trump  has attacked the mainstream media as âfake newsâ and âenemies of the American people â casting the reporters who cover  him  as adversaries in a way that hasnât been seen since Richard Nixon.
 Trump  mentioned Wednesday's one-year anniversary at a rally with U.S. troops in Japan on Sunday  taking credit for economic progress since that ""very  very special day.""
A tweet and a promise:  Trump  finds campaign pledges easy to tweet  harder to keep
One year later   Trump  voters blame the president's tweets for his troubles
The sense of uncertainty and peril has been fueled by investigations into allegations that members of  Team Trump  may have colluded with Russian meddling in the election  which the president denies. The first indictments and plea deal announced last week by special counsel Robert Mueller signaled the opening of a new and potentially explosive new chapter on that scandal.
For  Trump   turbulence is a tactic and disruption a selling point.
âI think the American people elected somebody whoâs tough  whoâs smart and whoâs a fighter â White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a vigorous defense of his leadership style. âAnd thatâs  Donald Trump .â
Indeed   President Trump  is a lot like  Candidate Trump : A combative puncher and counter-puncher who wonât or canât back away from a fight or an insult. A master of social media who has deployed what amounts to a provocative personal broadcasting system. A critic of the establishment  even in his own party.
 Trump  declines to accommodate to the standard practices of  his  modern predecessors  including  his  refusal to release  his  tax returns. In recent days   he  blasted the actions of  his  own administration  calling the Armyâs decision not to imprison Bowe Bergdahl for desertion âa complete and total disgraceâ and saying  he  was âvery unhappyâ with the Justice Department for not pursuing investigations of Clinton.","Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE In his election victory speech   Trump  promised to be ""president for all Americans"" and said it was time to ""bind the wounds of division.""

5281,Trump Grudgingly Recertifies the Nuclear Deal,Trump,"Trump  agreed to re-certify that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal  but  he  did so very grudgingly:
 President Trump  agreed on Monday to certify again that Iran is complying with an international nuclear agreement that  he  has strongly criticized  but only after hours of arguing with  his  top national security advisers  briefly upending a planned announcement as a legal deadline loomed.
The danger here is that  Trumpâs instincts  are to trash the deal and to deny that Iran is in compliance despite the fact that Tehran has been complying with the agreement from the start. Eventually   those instincts  are likely to prevail over other concerns. That is not surprising given  his  repeated attacks on the JCPOA as the âworstâ deal ever made. It is still alarming that the U.S. might renege on its obligations and potentially blow up the deal for no reason. The article continues:
The decision on Monday was the second time  his  administration certified Iranâs compliance  and aides said  a frustrated Mr. Trump  had told  his  security team that  he  would not keep doing so indefinitely [bold mine-DL].
The danger isnât limited to  Trumpâs  bad judgment. There are many dead-ender Iran hawks that never wanted the nuclear deal and are still desperate to sabotage it. Because the administration will have to certify that the deal is in the national security interests of the U.S. every 90 days  those saboteurs will have numerous opportunities to lobby  Trump  to change  his  mind. The Iran deal is succeeding  but hard-liners here are so determined to wreck it that they donât care. Hostility to Iran is one of the few reliable constants in  Trump âs foreign policy  and the administration is making clear that  Trump  wants to increase tensions with Iran on every other front:
Administration officials announced the certification on Monday evening while emphasizing that they intended to toughen enforcement of the deal  apply new sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism and other destabilizing activities  and negotiate with European partners to craft a broader strategy to increase pressure on Tehran. Aides said  Mr. Trump  had insisted on such actions before agreeing to the consensus recommendation of  his  national security team.
That means that most of the other possible benefits that the deal could have produced in the form of reduced regional tensions and diplomatic channels with Tehran will be thrown away for the sake of fruitless antagonism and confrontation. This is by far the most dangerous aspect of  Trump âs foreign policy to date  but it is unfortunately the one where he will encounter the least resistance in Washington.
The report makes clear that the entire deal would be cast aside if  Trump  had  his  way.  His  advisers spent the last meeting trying to get  Trump  to agree  and  he  refused for almost all of  it  until the very end:
At an hourlong meeting last Wednesday  all of the presidentâs major security advisers recommended  he  preserve the Iran deal for now. Among those who spoke out were Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson; Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster  the national security adviser; and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr.  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  according to an official who described internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.

Just as surely as she pulls the ball away from Charlie Brown  sending him skyward and crashing flat on his back   Trump  repeatedly lures  his  apologists into cooing about  his  new âpresidentialâ voice and rationalizing  his  absurdities. And each and every time   he  leaves them humiliated  flat on their backs.
A week ago at the State of  the Union Trump  declared  âTonight  I call upon on all of us to set aside our differences  to seek out common ground and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. â¦ All of us  together  as one team  one people  and one American family  can do anything. We all share the same home  the same heart  the same destiny  and the same great American flag.â Reaching across the aisle! Offering an open hand! Monday  as the stock market was tumbling   Trump  sneered at Democrats who did not swoon over  his  State of the Union address. âThey were like death. And un-American. Un-American. Somebody said  âtreasonous.â I mean  yeah  I guess  why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean  they certainly didnât seem to love our country very much.â Splat! There goes another gang of  Trump  apologists. (Now  after media outlets and Democratic office-holders have blasted his language  the White House claims it was all a âjoke â the administrationâs most overused and ineffective tactic when defending the indefensible.)
Some Republicans will ignore the remarks; others will scream at the media for covering them. Others will rationalize it. As of this writing  there has been little pushback from the GOP. Republicansâ refusal to call out the most base language  the language of dictators  confirms their capitulation â political and moral â to  Trump . (These are the same people who insist Republicans cannot be tarred with a broad brush in 2018 because they donât share Trumpâs racist  xenophobic and anti-democratic views.)
 Trumpâs  defenders have scoffed at critics who cite  Trumpâs  attack on the free press  the courts and even the notion of objective reality. Theyâve decried an investigation into the presidentâs cooperation with Russians  of which there is substantial evidence he was willing to receive help from a hostile power. (âHe at least tacitly collaborated with a foreign-intelligence operation against his country â sometimes in full public view â write Ben Wittes and Jonathan Rauch. âThis started during the campaign  when he called upon the Russians to steal and release his opponentâs emails  and has continued during his presidency  as he equivocates on whether foreign intervention occurred and smears intelligence professionals who stand by the facts.â) And now  Trumpâs  devoted followers are content to allow  him  to call Democrats treasonous for not applauding  their  Great Leader.
During the campaign   Trump  fans ridiculed concerns that he was undemocratic and prone to demonstrate an unhealthy affection for authoritarianism and autocratic leaders  most especially Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Now as he confirms the worst of those fears  Republicans wave off evidence of  Trumpâs  undemocratic and  yes  anti-American rhetoric.
If you believe in the rule of law  democratic norms and institutions and decent public debate  Republicans must pay a heavy  heavy price for indulging  Trump . I am compelled to agree with Wittes and Rauch: âThe goal is to make the Republican Party answerable at every level  exacting a political price so stinging as to force the party back into the democratic fold.â (Thatâs small âdâ democratic.) Whether you think the GOP is salvageable or not  to reelect this crew in the midterms is to complete the capitulation to  Trumpâs  anti-democratic brand of politics.

5283,Trump Intended To Fire Special Counsel Mueller In June 'New York Times' Says : NPR,Trump,"Trump  Intended To Fire Special Counsel Mueller In June  'New York Times' Says
 President Trump  ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller last summer â but McGahn refused and threatened to quit himself if  the president  went ahead  according to an explosive report in The New York Times.
 Trump   in brief remarks as he entered the conference hall at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  dismissed the story in what has become his characteristic fashion.
""Fake news. Fake news  "" Trump  said in brief remarks as  he  entered the conference hall. ""Typical New York Times. Fake stories.""
Neither attorneys for  Trump  nor the Justice Department would immediately comment on the story.
The Times story described  Trump  formulating a case against Mueller as someone who could investigate possible  Trump  campaign involvement with Russia's attack on the 2016 election.
 Trump  argued Mueller had conflicts of interest: over Mueller's onetime membership at one of  Trump 's golf courses; over his connection to a law firm that represented Trump's son-in-law; and over the interview he had done with  Trump  to possibly take over the FBI after  Trump  had just fired then-Director James Comey.
Mueller had served as a longtime director of the bureau and was Comey's predecessor; NPR reported last June that  Trump  had placed  him  on the shortlist to take over after Comey's dismissal.
But even though McGahn did not go along with  Trump 's desire to get rid of Mueller  the White House's top lawyer had reportedly been part of an earlier pressure campaign on the Justice Department. McGahn has been described as the conduit for requests by  Trump  that Attorney General Jeff Sessions not recuse himself from the Russia matter â although he ultimately did â and that FBI Director Christopher Wray get rid of Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Wray has not agreed.
And the complaint about Mueller's ""conflicts"" has become a leitmotif of Republican criticism of the special counsel's office  the Justice Department and the FBI.  Trump  allies  particularly in the House  have zeroed in on what  they  said was Mueller's failure to investigate the sale of a uranium company and what's been described as his withholding of information from Congress as reasons he must step down or Sessions must appoint a second special counsel.
The Justice Department's inspector general is looking into its handling of recent high-profile political cases  including the private email server used by Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state. Mueller has removed at least one investigator from the Russia unit whom the inspector general discovered had criticized  Trump  in text messages on his FBI-issued phone.
 Trump  himself said in a surprise appearance on Wednesday that  he  is looking forward to giving a personal interview to Mueller  under oath.  His  legal team said the president's comments took place as  he  ""hurried"" to leave for  his  trip for Switzerland and they have made clear that negotiations for an interview with Mueller are still ongoing.","[TGT] Intended To Fire Special Counsel Mueller In June  'New York Times' Says

5284,Man of the Americas: Five Ways Donald Trump Has Promoted Latin American Freedom,Donald Trump,"In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election  Democrats and left-wing media sought to portray  Donald Trump  as the anti-Latino candidate.
However   his  record in office speaks otherwise.
Since  his  inauguration in January  the  Trump  administration has consistently sought to promote freedom and prosperity across the region. Here are some examples:
In June   Trump  took steps to roll back the Obama administrationâs âCuban thaw â which involved the warming of relations with the communist Cuban dictatorship through the lifting of travel restrictions  increased trade  and the reopening of embassies in both countries.
Under the new  Trump  regulations  the United States would prevent âindividual people-to-people exchanges â largely used by wealthy Americans to engage in prohibited tourism on the island.  Trump  made clear the objective of this regulation would be to limit the amount of American money entering the coffers of the Cuban military  which controls the vast majority of Cubaâs tourism industry.
While left-wing figures praised the legacy of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro following his death last November   Trump  also expressed solidarity with the Cuban people.
âToday  the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades â  Trump  said after Castroâs death  noting that his legacy was âone of firing squads  theft  unimaginable suffering  poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.â
In a speech to Cuban-Americans in Miami this year   Trump  also promised to âexpose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom.â
""Remarks by  President Trump  on the Policy of the U.S.A. Towards Cuba""
Since the outset of his presidency   Trump  has repeatedly shown  his  support for the Venezuelan people with both statements and sanctions designed to exert pressure on the socialist dictatorship amid the countryâs unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
 Trump  has repeatedly warned that the United States will ânot stand by as Venezuela crumblesâ and has even refused ruled out military action in response to the crisis.
Following the creation of an illegal lawmaking body known as the âconstituent assembly â effectively rendered the country into a dictatorship  the  Trump  administration has placed personal sanctions on Maduro  which include the freezing of assets and travel restrictions  as well as broader sanctions banning Americans from dealing in Venezuelan government debt or that of  its  state-run oil company.
In a speech at the United Nations in September   Trump  also blamed the socialist ideology that has led to Venezuelaâs collapse.
âThe problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented  but that socialism has been faithfully implemented â  Trump  continued. âFrom the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela  wherever true socialism or Communism has been adopted it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure.â
 Trump  has forged relationships with some of Latin Americaâs right-wing governments  including Peruvian president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski  Brazilian president Michel Temer  and Argentine leader Mauricio Macri.
Following his election victory last year   Trump  and Brazilâs Temer spoke over the phone and agreed to work together to improve business relations between the two largest economies in the Americas.","In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election  Democrats and left-wing media sought to portray   [TGT]

5285,Trump 's New Reality Show: Let's Make a Deal on Dreamers,Trump,"WASHINGTON - Trump  has been flip-flopping lately on what should be done about illegal immigrants known as Dreamers who were brought here when they were infants or children by their undocumented parents.
 He  ran for president on a promise that was the bedrock issue of  his  2016 campaign to deport all of the estimated 11 to 12 million migrants  including their kids who grew up here  went to school here and many of whom work here.
Now  he  says  he âs willing to make a deal with Congress  allowing many if not most of these young people to remain in the U.S. under the âDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivalsâ program (DACA) begun under President Obama that may offer a possible path to citizenship.
Late last month  after some two years of sticking to  his  deportation plan   he  had a sudden change of heart about separating families whose kids have grown up and know little if anything about the countries they came from.
 His  hardcore supporters are up in arms that  he  is caving in on one of  his  repeated campaign pledges  while others are reminding  him  of  his  public declaration last year âto show great heartâ toward the dreamers.
This week the White House made it clear that  he  is in the midst of negotiating a deal on Capitol Hill that would let many if not all of the dreamers remain here  but only if the Congress will fork over the money  he  wants to build  his  wall along the 2 500 mile border with Mexico  and pay for the hiring of thousands of federal immigration enforcement officers and judges.
The switch in  his  thinking came when strategists told  him  that the DACA program is popular on the Hill  and that  he  has to give up something Congress wants in order to get what  he  needs in return.
 Trump  tweeted  his  demands late last month to make sure lawmakers understood what  he  needed from them in return for embracing most if not all of the DACA program.
There âcan be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL â  he  told them.
 Trump  announced near the end of last year that  he  planned to terminate the DACA program  but later made it clear  he  could be bought off if the deal was right.
 âTrump  suggested  he  would be open to a deal with Democrats that included providing legal status for immigrants in the program â the Washington Post reported Wednesday.
And  he  sweetened the deal by adding âthat the physical wall did not necessarily have to be among the immediate concessions â the Post said.","[TGT] has been flip-flopping lately on what should be done about illegal immigrants known as Dreamers who were brought here when they were infants or children by their undocumented parents.

5287,SCHAEFFER: Who Owns This Economy Obama Or Trump?,Obama,"So  the 20 trillion-dollar question is this:  Which president  owns this booming economy? Obama or Trump?
The argument in favor of former-president Obama  often heard among the Democrat Party cocktail set as they scramble to somehow put a left-wing veneer on the good times  goes something like this:
 President Obama  inherited an absolute mess. At the time of  his  election in November 2008  the stock market was in a free-fall  having tumbled from a high of roughly 14 000 to 6 500  a -53% decline that took some of Wall Streetâs oldest and most venerated institutions like Lehman Brothers down with it. The shock to the credit system created a deep freeze. The 2008 crash was not just in equities but in a speculative real estate bubble fueled by criminally easy-to-obtain mortgages that placed millions of unqualified borrowers in peril as their home values collapsed and the equity upon which their predatory loans were based disintegrated right at the same moment teaser rates kicked in; this cocktail of disaster made it easier for them to just leave the keys in the mailbox for the bank than try to service their loans. Consumer confidence plummeted  unemployment began its unrelenting march from 5% at the beginning of 2008 to the October 2009 high of 10%.
This all happened on Obamaâs watch  and if the rooster crows as the sun rises  it must be the roosterâs doing. But was it really?
First  letâs take a look at how the economy outside of Wall Street  big government  and the college campus fared in the so-called â Obama  recovery.â Here are some general observations. Home ownership: down. Labor force participation: down. Student loans: up. National Debt: up. Health care costs: up. Median family income: flat. People on food stamps: up. Workersâ share of economy: down. These trends do not paint a rosy picture for the working middle class. Is it any wonder that the fabled Democrat âblue wallâ crumbled in 2016?
So what gives? How could the overall economy improve and yet not benefit the average American? One would think if Americans were truly happy with the  Obama  years  they wouldnât have turned over the levers of power from the statehouse to the governorsâ mansions  to the Congress and the White House to the Republicans during Obamaâs tenure.
Letâs look at the overall economy in 2008-2009 when  Obama  took over  which first and foremost needed a shot of credit confidence to get moving again . . . after all  if Lehman collapsed and AIG was on the brink of insolvency  were any firms safe? Thus  did investment capital  the grease in the countryâs economic machine  dry up and move to cash. So  what did  Obama  do to unfreeze credit? Actually  the most important government intervention in those critical times was the Bush administrationâs Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In a move right out of Hamiltonâs playbook  Hank Paulson at the Treasury Department assumed the bad debts of private institutions onto the only balance sheet large enough to hold them while all got sorted out: the federal governmentâs. Among any government actions  it was TARP (one this disciple of Adam Smith grudgingly supported under the âdesperate times call for desperate measuresâ category) that stopped the collapse and stabilized the economy. Once capital felt like it was safe to get back into the water  the foundation for a recovery was in place. ARP was also something  President Obama  inherited.
So why the steady stock market rally during Obamaâs term? Surely  Obama  should be credited with that. Well  unlike the weeks after Trumpâs election  those following Obamaâs saw the DJIA shed an additional 3 000 points  or another 30%. What set the equities markets on a tear was not so much White House fiscal policies such as the wasted $800 billion on a stimulus package with a face that only a die-hard neo-Keynesian could love  but rather monetary policy courtesy of the independent Federal Reserve. The Fed Funds rate fell from 5.25% in October 2008 to as low as 0.05% in December 2009 and remained below 1.0% until July 2017  in effect making it nearly costless to borrow money. The subsequent miniscule proceeds of debt instruments prompted a chase for yield. And where could one earn more than the nominal rate of inflation? Equities of course. And which countryâs markets are the safest and most secure? The United Statesâ. Hence the bull market. ( Obama  could  in fact  be called one of the greatest presidents Wall Street ever had . . . which doesnât help a trucker  or machinist  or oil rig worker . . . something the Democrats failed to understand as their power in middle America slipped away.)
Very often a presidentâs mantra when acting as de facto steward of the worldâs largest economy is  ""first do no harm."" Did  Obama  adhere to this tenet? No. In his brief window of opportunity when Democrats controlled Congress  he pushed through a slew of punishing  anti-business âreformsâ and regulations. The ill-conceived Dodd-Frank law (brought to us by the two legislators whose dirty fingerprints were on the real estate debacle more than any othersâ)  the assumption of control of one-sixth of the economy in the already-imploding Affordable Care Act  which spawned no fewer than 20 separate tax hikes  the war on coal and even Keystone XL in favor of as-yet unprofitable green start-ups  poor trade deals  a climate accord that punished us while giving our chief economic competitors a free pass for a decade  etc.  did nothing to spur economic growth.

So why did the economy improve? Because no one man can stop it. He can only impede its progress. Economic cycles are part of the ebb and flow of business  and  as a rule  the more precipitous the fall  the quicker and steeper the recovery. But not so in the case of the Obama years  where the U.S. economy never achieved an annualized GDP of above 3%. By contrast  not only has the first year of the Trump administration produced an annualized GDP of above 3%  the Atlanta Fed projects a GDP in the first quarter of 2018 to be as high as 5.4%.
The U.S. economy is resilient. It can endure the stifling effects of neo-Keynesian folly and tap into the animal spirits (ironically a term coined by Keynes himself) to propel the engine of growth forward. It is not that  Obama  deserves no credit for where we are. Indeed  many of the charts went from the lower left to upper right under his watch. But one can certainly argue that his stubborn adherence to failed left-wing statist dogma acted as a sea anchor on what should have been a far more robust recovery given the steep recession he inherited. When investors woke up on November 9  2016  they saw before them a more business-friendly government. One they did not expect. The proof is in what those charts look like since that day. Trumpâs policies since have merely removed the sea anchors  allowing the USA to reach its previously untapped potential.","So  the 20 trillion-dollar question is this:  Which president  owns this booming economy? Obama or Trump?
The argument in favor of former-president Obama  often heard among the Democrat Party cocktail set as they scramble to somehow put a left-wing veneer on the good times  goes something like this:
  [TGT] inherited an absolute mess. At the time of   [TGT]   election in November 2008  the stock market was in a free-fall  having tumbled from a high of roughly 14 000 to 6 500  a -53% decline that took some of Wall Streetâs oldest and most venerated institutions like Lehman Brothers down with it. The shock to the credit system created a deep freeze. The 2008 crash was not just in equities but in a speculative real estate bubble fueled by criminally easy-to-obtain mortgages that placed millions of unqualified borrowers in peril as their home values collapsed and the equity upon which their predatory loans were based disintegrated right at the same moment teaser rates kicked in; this cocktail of disaster made it easier for them to just leave the keys in the mailbox for the bank than try to service their loans. Consumer confidence plummeted  unemployment began its unrelenting march from 5% at the beginning of 2008 to the October 2009 high of 10%.
This all happened on Obamaâs watch  and if the rooster crows as the sun rises  it must be the roosterâs doing. But was it really?
First  letâs take a look at how the economy outside of Wall Street  big government  and the college campus fared in the so-called â Obama  recovery.â Here are some general observations. Home ownership: down. Labor force participation: down. Student loans: up. National Debt: up. Health care costs: up. Median family income: flat. People on food stamps: up. Workersâ share of economy: down. These trends do not paint a rosy picture for the working middle class. Is it any wonder that the fabled Democrat âblue wallâ crumbled in 2016?
So what gives? How could the overall economy improve and yet not benefit the average American? One would think if Americans were truly happy with the   [TGT]  [TGT]   [TGT]  have turned over the levers of power from the statehouse to the governorsâ mansions  to the Congress and the White House to the Republicans during Obamaâs tenure.
Letâs look at the overall economy in 2008-2009 when   [TGT] took over  which first and foremost needed a shot of credit confidence to get moving again . . . after all  if Lehman collapsed and AIG was on the brink of insolvency  were any firms safe? Thus  did investment capital  the grease in the countryâs economic machine  dry up and move to cash. So  what did   [TGT] do to unfreeze credit? Actually  the most important government intervention in those critical times was the Bush administrationâs Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In a move right out of Hamiltonâs playbook  Hank Paulson at the Treasury Department assumed the bad debts of private institutions onto the only balance sheet large enough to hold them while all got sorted out: the federal governmentâs. Among any government actions  it was TARP (one this disciple of Adam Smith grudgingly supported under the âdesperate times call for desperate measuresâ category) that stopped the collapse and stabilized the economy. Once capital felt like it was safe to get back into the water  the foundation for a recovery was in place. ARP was also something   [TGT] inherited.
So why the steady stock market rally during Obamaâs term? Surely   [TGT] should be credited with that. Well  unlike the weeks after Trumpâs election  those following Obamaâs saw the DJIA shed an additional 3 000 points  or another 30%. What set the equities markets on a tear was not so much White House fiscal policies such as the wasted $800 billion on a stimulus package with a face that only a die-hard neo-Keynesian could love  but rather monetary policy courtesy of the independent Federal Reserve. The Fed Funds rate fell from 5.25% in October 2008 to as low as 0.05% in December 2009 and remained below 1.0% until July 2017  in effect making it nearly costless to borrow money. The subsequent miniscule proceeds of debt instruments prompted a chase for yield. And where could one earn more than the nominal rate of inflation? Equities of course. And which countryâs markets are the safest and most secure? The United Statesâ. Hence the bull market. (  [TGT] could  in fact  be called one of the greatest presidents Wall Street ever had . . . which doesnât help a trucker  or machinist  or oil rig worker . . . something the Democrats failed to understand as their power in middle America slipped away.)
Very often a presidentâs mantra when acting as de facto steward of the worldâs largest economy is  ""first do no harm."" Did   [TGT] adhere to this tenet? No. In his brief window of opportunity when Democrats controlled Congress  he pushed through a slew of punishing  anti-business âreformsâ and regulations. The ill-conceived Dodd-Frank law (brought to us by the two legislators whose dirty fingerprints were on the real estate debacle more than any othersâ)  the assumption of control of one-sixth of the economy in the already-imploding Affordable Care Act  which spawned no fewer than 20 separate tax hikes  the war on coal and even Keystone XL in favor of as-yet unprofitable green start-ups  poor trade deals  a climate accord that punished us while giving our chief economic competitors a free pass for a decade  etc.  did nothing to spur economic growth. It did create an entirely new layer of costly public and private sector bureaucracy dedicated to navigating the new world of compliance with government activism.
So why did the economy improve? Because no one man can stop it. He can only impede its progress. Economic cycles are part of the ebb and flow of business  and  as a rule  the more precipitous the fall  the quicker and steeper the recovery.

5289,Trump Ends DACA Calls On Congress To Act : NPR,Trump,"Trump Ends DACA  Calls On Congress To Act
 The Trump administration  Tuesday formally announced  it  will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program â also called DACA â putting an expiration date on the legal protections granted to roughly 800 000 people known as ""DREAMers "" who entered the country illegally as children.
 President Trump  issued a statement  saying  ""I do not favor punishing children  most of whom are now adults  for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.""
 He  also said  he  looks forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to address immigration issues ""in a manner that puts the hardworking citizens of our country first.""
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said  Trump  ""wrestled"" with the decision to end DACA over the weekend. In an afternoon briefing  she denied the decision was ""coldhearted "" painting it as the alternative to an immediate shutdown of the program by a federal court. She said  the president  wants DACA made permanent as part of ""comprehensive"" immigration legislation that would end illegal immigration  prevent visa overstays and create a ""merit based"" system of immigration.
 Trump  signaled the decision earlier on Tuesday  tweeting  ""Congress  get ready to do your job - DACA.""
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called the administration's decision ""heartless."" He said Democrats ""will do everything we can to prevent  President Trump 's terribly wrong order from becoming reality.""
The DREAMers had been in legal limbo since the start of the current administration. Throughout his campaign   Trump  railed against the 2012 executive order signed by Obama â and pledged to ""immediately terminate the policy"" once he took office.
But after being sworn in  he expressed some compassion toward DACA recipients. In an interview with ABC News on Jan. 25   Trump  said  ""They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody.""
The Obama program was thrown into the center of a looming court battle in late June when a coalition of 10 state attorneys general  led by Texas' Ken Paxton  threatened to sue the  Trump  administration as early as Sept. 5 if it refused to phase out DACA. They argued that Obama had overstepped his authority in creating and implementing the program. Only Congress has the authority to legislate such a change in U.S. immigration law  they contended.
Sessions had advocated for the termination of DACA but  as BuzzFeed reported in March  he was often outargued by former chief of staff Reince Priebus and former chief strategist Steve Bannon  who like  Trump  wanted to see it preserved.
But with Bannon and Priebus now gone from the West Wing  it appears the position held by Sessions and Stephen Miller  another  Trump White House  aide with ties to Sessions  has won out â under the pressure exerted by Paxton and some of his fellow state attorneys general.
 Trump 's decision leaves Congress facing increasing pressure to find a solution for a population that was estimated in 2012 to include as many as 1.8 million immigrants â of which about 800 000 have been granted deferred status under DACA.
At the moment there are at least two bipartisan bills that could grant legal status or create a pathway to citizenship for those who were eligible for DACA. In July  Sens. Dick Durbin  D-Ill.  and Lindsey Graham  R-S.C.  introduced a new version of the DREAM Act  after which the DREAMers are named. And a companion bill was filed in  the House  by Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen  R-Fla.  and Lucille Roybal-Allard  D-Calif.
Graham added  ""The Congress is going to have to up its game."" He said he agreed with the  Trump  administration that Obama's executive action was an ""unconstitutional overreach "" and said  President Trump  was ""also right to give us six months to figure out a solution to this.""
Durbin introduced an earlier version of the DREAM Act â the ""Development  Relief  and Education for Alien Minors Act"" â in late 2010; that bill failed to get enough votes to allow a floor vote. But the legislative project goes back much longer than the middle of Obama's first term as president. Durbin first filed legislation about the DREAMers in 2001. ""Other versions passed  the House  in 2010 and in the Senate  as part of a larger immigration bill  in 2013.

The Fed meeting occurred even while  President Trump  is planning significant changes in the central bankâs makeup.  Trump  on Thursday is expected to name Republican Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the next chairman. A centrist  Powell is likely to maintain Yellenâs cautious strategy of only gradual rate increases to avoid disrupting the recovery. But  he  may be more open to easing some regulations on banks than Yellen  a Democrat.

 President Trump  said on Dec. 5 that the Democrats ""are looking at shutting down"" the government over immigration. (The Washington Post)
 President Trump  raised the possibility of a government shutdown ahead of a meeting with Democrats for a second consecutive week on Wednesday  even as tensions on Capitol Hill appeared to diminish after hard-line House conservatives backed off plans to oppose a short-term stopgap.
âIt could happen â  Trump  said about a shutdown before a Cabinet meeting  pointing to Democratic demands on immigration policy. âThe Democrats are really looking at something that is very dangerous for our country.â
âThey want to have illegal immigrants pouring into our country  bringing with them crime  tremendous amounts of crime â  he  added. âWe donât want to have that. We want to have a great  beautiful  crime-free country.â
Top congressional leaders from both parties are set to meet with  the president  Thursday at the White House as they seek a deal on lifting spending caps that would allow more funding for the military and nondefense programs. Democrats are also expected to bring up a potential deal on immigration that would include protections for at least 790 000 âdreamers â immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.
Plans for a meeting between the president and leading Democrats scheduled for last week fell apart after  Trump  tweeted âI donât see a dealâ hours beforehand.

The issue then  as now  was immigration. âProblem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked  are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes â  Trump  wrote on Nov. 28.
Responding to  Trump âs comment Wednesday  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) did not indicate Democrats would be backing out of Thursdayâs meeting.
â President Trump  is the only person talking about a government shutdown â she said in a statement. âDemocrats are hopeful  the President  will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the American people and keep government open.â","[TGT] said on Dec. 5 that the Democrats ""are looking at shutting down"" the government over immigration.

5296,Trump âs shifting stance on guns leaves lawmakers baffled,Trump,"In  his  quest to tackle gun violence   President Donald Trump  has ricocheted between calling for tougher laws and declaring  his  fealty to the Second Amendment's right to bear arms  leaving a trail of befuddled lawmakers and advocates in  his  wake.
One thing  he  still has not done: clearly outline  his  legislative priorities.
Washington's week closed Friday without further explanation from the president  the White House indicating that for now  at least   he  is backing an incremental proposal on background checks and a bill that would provide new federal dollars to stem school violence.
Just what  Trump  would like to see in the ""beautiful"" and ""comprehensive"" bill  he  called for earlier in the week remained unclear. That comment came at a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers Wednesday  which was quickly followed by a private session with the National Rifle Association on Thursday.
""Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!""  Trump  tweeted Thursday night.
 He  had outlined some of  his  preferences via Twitter earlier Thursday  saying that both good and bad ideas had come out of the bipartisan meeting.  He  said: ""Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years  a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!""
Disagreement continues among legislators over the appropriate response after the Florida school shooting that left 17 dead. Republicans have largely backed away from stricter gun limits  while Democrats emboldened by  Trump 's rhetoric are pushing for ambitious action  including expanded background checks and even a politically risky ban on assault weapons.
Still  he added: ""Trump's instinct on this issue is not wrong â if his party doesn't get behind background checks soon  they're cooked in 2018 and 2020."" And he argued that  Trump 's ""willingness to buck the gun lobby in public  rule out the NRA agenda and talk up background checks  has changed this debate nationally.""
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that  Trump  supports a limited proposal from Sen. John Cornyn  R-Texas  and Murphy that would boost participation in the existing federal background check program  as well as a bill that would provide new federal grant funding to stem school violence.
Sanders said  Trump  had not signed on to a more sweeping background check bill that would require the review of firearm purchases online and at gun shows. The measure  from Sens. Pat Toomey  R-Pa.  and Joe Manchin  D-W.Va.  has found new momentum since it was first introduced after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that left 20 children dead.
Sanders sought to clarify  Trump 's comments earlier in the week expressing support for tougher background checks and interest in raising the minimum age to buy certain weapons. She said he was interested in improving background checks  but ""not necessarily universal background checks."" And she said that while  Trump  ""conceptually"" supports higher age requirements to purchase certain weapons  ""he also knows there's not a lot of broad support for that.""","In  his  quest to tackle gun violence    [TGT] has ricocheted between calling for tougher laws and declaring   [TGT]   fealty to the Second Amendment's right to bear arms  leaving a trail of befuddled lawmakers and advocates in   [TGT]   wake.

5297,Oh Great: Congress Has One Week to Prevent a Government Shutdown,Trump,"Friday was a busy day in Washington  DC. The Senate was preparing to vote on a major tax bill that was still being negotiated at the same time former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was pleading guilty to lying to federal agents as part of a deal to cooperate with Robert Muellerâs probe into the  Trump  campaign. And looming over all of this is yet another potential crisis: On December 8  the federal government will run out of money unless Congress acts fast.
The government was initially set to run out of funding on September 30. But at the start of that month   Donald Trump  struck a surprise deal with Democratic leaders in Congress to fund the government through December 8. The plan at the time was ostensibly to free up time to work on tax reform  handle any other pressing issues  and gradually work out a deal to fund the government through September 2018. Then Republicans wasted September on a futile attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA)  and tax reform got complicated real fast.
Those big-ticket items mean that other priorities are being pushed aside in the hope that they could be wrapped into a funding deal. That includes: funding for the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  which has been running on fumes since Congress failed to renew it in late September; restoring protections that  Trump  scuttled in September for around 800 000 âDreamers â undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as children; stabilizing the ACAâs individual markets after  Trump  said  he âd stop paying a key subsidy to insurers in October; providing a third tranche of disaster relief funding for communities hit by the summerâs hurricanes and wildfires; and reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program  a major National Security Agency surveillance program  and a number of other federal programs.
That seemed to fall apart on Tuesday morning. Just before a major negotiation session between Trump and congressional leaders from both parties  the president fired off a brash tweet saying that he didnât see any possible deal and insulting the Democrats. The Democrats pulled out of the meeting  and now even progress towards an agreement on top-line spending numbers has stalled out.
But pushing a final funding bill into 2018 just increased pressure to tackle controversial issues by December 8. Many Democrats and some Republicans are unwilling to end 2017 without fixes for CHIP  protections for Dreamers  and disaster relief. They do not trust Trump or Republican leaders to make good on any promises to handle those issues without the pressure of a CR to attach it to.
As usual  no one really knows how  Trump  will react to all this.  The president  seems more willing to risk a shutdown than almost anyone in DC.  He  seems to believe  he  risks more by striking deals with the Democrats  like  he  did in September  and that  he  can fully blame any funding shenanigans on the Democrats. âThe president in these processes is a wildcard â said Harkins.","Friday was a busy day in Washington  DC.

5298,State of the Union: Trump extends âopen handâ to Dems but is met with glum stares scant applause,Trump,"President Trump  appealed for unity in  his  first State of the Union speech  declaring a ""new American moment"" even as many glum Democrats in the audience sat on their hands and refused to acknowledge economic gains or calls to honor veterans.
While  Trump  held firm on  his  demands for border security and used the grand setting to tout  his  first-year accomplishments   his  call for bipartisanship on the thorny immigration debate met with stonefaced stares from top Democrats such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
It remains unclear whether Democrats are ready to deal on immigration  but the issue could hang over a looming Feb. 8 deadline to pass a new spending bill. With that in mind   Trump  used  his  80-minute speech to signal a willingness to make bipartisan deals on second-year-agenda priorities like immigration as well as infrastructure.
The president described his recent offer on immigration as a ""fair compromise"" for both sides. The White House is pushing a plan to broaden eligibility for the DACA program â which gives a reprieve to illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children  and which  Trump  is planning to end absent a legislative solution â in exchange for border wall funding and other big changes.
""Tonight  I call upon all of us to set aside our differences  to seek out common ground  and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve."" - President Trump
Even as he pushed for an immigration deal  the president didnât stray from messaging aimed at his base.  Trump  said  his  âhighest loyalty  my greatest compassion  and my constant concern is for America's children  America's struggling workers  and America's forgotten communities.â
âAmericans are dreamers  too â  he  said.
 He  also called on Congress to ""finally close the deadly loopholes"" that have allowed MS-13 to flourish inside the country.
""We will build gleaming new roads  bridges  highways  railways and waterways all across our land  and we will do it with American heart  and American hands  and American grit  "" Trump  said.
âThis is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream.â - President Trump
Like other presidents before him   Trump  used the address to tout first-year accomplishments like the GOP tax cut bill  regulation rollbacks  the elimination of ObamaCareâs individual mandate and gains made over the last year against the Islamic State.
Insisting that the âera of economic surrender is over â  Trump  reiterated  his  campaign promises to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And  he  celebrated the stock market gains during  his  first year in office.

5300,To North Korea  Trumpâs military parade will look like fear not strength,Trump,"I spend a lot of time watching military parades. Itâs not because I particularly like them â in fact  I find them tedious and jingoistic â but because often they are a source of valuable information about countries such as Russia  China and North Korea  where thatâs usually hard to come by. Analysts like me scrutinize both the military hardware on display and the leaders watching  the parade .
Parades in places like China and North Korea only make sense if we understand the broader propaganda context in which they take place. And from my experience analyzing parades there  I can predict how the military parade  President Trump  wants to hold in Washington this year might play in Moscow  Beijing or Pyongyang.
It will not  despite what  Trump  may think  be seen as a sign of American confidence.
[Iâm an Iraq war veteran. The military doesnât want or need Trumpâs parade.]
But parades are already a recurring leitmotif of the  Trump  era: One of the presidentâs fondest memories  going by how often he mentions it  is leading cadets from his military academy in a Columbus Day parade.  Trump  reportedly wanted to include military vehicles in  his  inaugural parade  and now  having seen a grand military parade in France for Bastille Day   he âs pushing the idea with the Pentagon again.
Are we really going to be looking at where John Kelly sits or how  Trump  reacts to him to determine whether Kelly is likely to remain as chief of staff or be removed in a staff purge? Or wondering whether the inclusion of an F-35 flyover means that the program no longer suffers presidential disapproval? I suppose we are.
And yet  of all the reasons to be uncomfortable with the idea of a parade  I am not bothered that the United States will look like Russia  China or North Korea.  Trump  is a stain on our democracy  parade or no parade.
There is a deeper  more disconcerting issue here  though  that goes beyond whatever divisions and military equipment march down Pennsylvania Avenue. In an interview with The Washington Post before his inauguration   Trump  placed the issue of parades in a broader context about signaling military strength: âWeâre going to show the people as we build up our military. â¦ That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington  D.C.  for parades. I mean  weâre going to be showing our military.â
In this way  I fear  Trump âs parade may backfire. A massive demonstration of military might  especially if it includes some aspect of the nationâs nuclear deterrent  is only going to convince Kim Jong Un and others that the United States sees its power flagging and is frightened. Itâs like telling a bully our biggest fear  except weâre putting it on a float and rolling it through downtown Washington.
 Inexplicably  Trump  and  his  ilk do not seem to grasp this  although  they  are extraordinarily intuitive bullies.  Trump  has made a career of taking up residence inside  his  enemiesâ heads.  His  supporters openly celebrate flaunting democratic norms not despite the outrage they cause  but to elicit it. âTriggering libsâ is a call-to-arms for millions of red-hat wearing Trumpists: âOne sure way you know [the parade] is a great idea â one such pundit wrote  âis by how upset liberals have already become.â

And yet  of all the reasons to be uncomfortable with the idea of a parade  I am not bothered that the United States will look like Russia  China or North Korea.   [TGT] is a stain on our democracy  parade or no parade.
There is a deeper  more disconcerting issue here  though  that goes beyond whatever divisions and military equipment march down Pennsylvania Avenue. In an interview with The Washington Post before his inauguration    [TGT]   placed the issue of parades in a broader context about signaling military strength: âWeâre going to show the people as we build up our military. â¦ That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington  D.C.  for parades. I mean  weâre going to be showing our military.â
In this way  I fear  Trump âs parade may backfire. A massive demonstration of military might  especially if it includes some aspect of the nationâs nuclear deterrent  is only going to convince Kim Jong Un and others that the United States sees its power flagging and is frightened. Itâs like telling a bully our biggest fear  except weâre putting it on a float and rolling it through downtown Washington.
 Inexplicably   [TGT] and  his  ilk do not seem to grasp this  although  they  are extraordinarily intuitive bullies.   [TGT] has made a career of taking up residence inside   [TGT]   enemiesâ heads.   [TGT]   supporters openly celebrate flaunting democratic norms not despite the outrage they cause  but to elicit it. âTriggering libsâ is a call-to-arms for millions of red-hat wearing Trumpists: âOne sure way you know [the parade] is a great idea â one such pundit wrote  âis by how upset liberals have already become.â
How   [TGT] could tweet   [TGT]   way into nuclear war with North Korea

5301,John McCain op,Trump,"President Trump  does not seem to understand that  his  rhetoric and actions reverberate in the same way.  He  has threatened to continue  his  attempt to discredit the free press by bestowing âfake news awardsâ upon reporters and news outlets whose coverage  he  disagrees with. Whether  Trump  knows  it  or not  these efforts are being closely watched by foreign leaders who are already using  his  words as cover as they silence and shutter one of the key pillars of democracy.
Unfortunately  the  Trump  administrationâs attitude toward such behavior has been inconsistent at best and hypocritical at worst. While administration officials often condemn violence against reporters abroad   Trump  continues  his  unrelenting attacks on the integrity of American journalists and news outlets. This has provided cover for repressive regimes to follow suit. The phrase âfake newsâ â granted legitimacy by an American president â is being used by autocrats to silence reporters  undermine political opponents  stave off media scrutiny and mislead citizens. CPJ documented 21 cases in 2017 in which journalists were jailed on âfake newsâ charges.
Trumpâs attempts to undermine the free press also make it more difficult to hold repressive governments accountable. For decades  dissidents and human rights advocates have relied on independent investigations into government corruption to further their fight for freedom. But constant cries of âfake newsâ undercut this type of reporting and strip activists of one of their most powerful tools of dissent.

5303,Obama Campaigners Have Spent $3.4 Million Through Shell Group to Defeat Roy Moore,Obama,"Three secretive Washington  D.C. based consulting firms run by former  Obama  campaign staffers and two Democrat direct mail attack firms have combined to spend what is now more than $3.4 million through an independent expenditure shell group known as Highway 31 in an attempt to defeat conservative Republican Roy Moore in Tuesdayâs special election for the U.S. Senate in Alabama.
That means the ads spent in Alabama since the shell groupâs formation on November 6 constitute either in-kind contributions from the firms run by former  Obama  campaign staffers  or have been paid for by unknown donors â almost uncertainly out-of-state liberals.

5305,Mexican president's visit to White House postponed after testy Trump call,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto postponed plans for the Mexican leaderâs first visit to the White House  after a testy phone call involving Trumpâs push for a border wall  a senior U.S. official said on Saturday.
Mexican officials had been talking about a summit between  Trump  and Pena Nieto in the next few weeks  without specifying when.
The Washington Post  which first reported the delay earlier on Saturday  said the two leaders spoke for about 50 minutes on Tuesday. But the discussion led to an impasse when  Trump  would not agree to publicly affirm Mexicoâs position that it would not fund construction of the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
A Mexican official said  Trump  lost his temper during the conversation  the newspaper reported. But it said U.S. officials described  Trump  as frustrated and exasperated  because he believed it was unreasonable for Pena Nieto to want him to back off his campaign promise of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall.
Mexicoâs foreign ministry said it had nothing to say about the call  other than a statement on Tuesday that said  Trump  had expressed condolences for a helicopter crash in Mexico and both sides had committed to advancing the bilateral agenda of trade  migration and security.
The wall  a key item for  Trumpâs  political base of supporters  has become a sticking point in talks to keep alive a federal program that protects from deportation young people who were brought to the United States illegally as children.
In his latest budget proposal to Congress   Trump  requested $23 billion for border security  most of it for building the wall.
Pena Nieto  who met  Trump  in July on the sidelines of a G20 summit  canceled an earlier meeting after  Trump  threatened to impose a tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall.  Trump  also met the Mexican president once during the 2016 election campaign.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President  [TGT]  and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto postponed plans for the Mexican leaderâs first visit to the White House  after a testy phone call involving Trumpâs push for a border wall  a senior U.S. official said on Saturday.

5306,Donald Trump loves a parade,Donald Trump,"Pundits and lawmakers weighed in on  President Trump 's plans for a military parade in Washington. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)
So.  President Trump  wants a parade.  He  went to France and saw a parade  and  he  wants one like they had  but bigger and creepier (which  incidentally  is similar to what France said after seeing the American Revolution).
We had better have some elephants as well  and if a parade has elephants it had better include also a long line of captives paying tribute to Rome as they march toward the gladiatorial arena  so those had better be found.  Trump  will enjoy those  I think.
 Trump  will be presented with a medal  honoring  his  service that time  he  rescued a Marineâs hat from blowing off.
This desire for parades is a quirk  nothing more  and there is nothing particularly bizarre about it.  Trump  loves a military parade; that is simply a fact about  Trump  that is known. What is the point of a military if no one gets to see how big and impressive it is and watch you wielding it? In life  there is the joy of possessing and the joy of being seen to possess. Has  Trump  ever known the first joy? Has  he  ever entirely severed it from the second? If no one sees you having something  is it even worth having?
Theoretically we have a military not because we want to parade it around  but so we can protect the actual things we really like (freedom  oil  in some order). But never mind.  Trump  wants a parade.
Wait   Trump  will say  in a whisper  as Melania moves to rise. Do you not see it is still going?
Everyone will freeze where they are  for nothing coming down the parade route will be visible to their eyes. But  Trump  will see  it . Names will form on  his  lips that have not alighted there in decades. A teacher who never recognized  his  genius. Someone at Wharton who had said something just out of earshot and everyone around  him  had laughed  and then  Trump  had approached and the laughter had stopped.  Roy . The pope  not this one or the last one  but the one before. Frederick Douglass. Women  nameless and faceless and apologetic. People of all kinds  begging forgiveness.

5307,Trump 's refugee ban ends new screening rules coming,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump 's four-month worldwide ban on refugees ended Tuesday  officials said  as  his  administration prepared to unveil tougher new screening procedures.
Under an executive order  Trump  signed earlier this year  the United States had temporarily halted admissions for refugees from all countries  with some exceptions. The end-date written into the order came and went Tuesday with no new order from  Trump  to extend it  according to a State Department official  who wasn't authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity.
Refugees seeking entry to the U.S. will face what officials described as more stringent and thorough examination of their backgrounds  in line with  Trump 's ""extreme vetting"" policy for immigrants. The Homeland Security Department  the State Department and other U.S. agencies have been reviewing the screening process during the temporary ban.
Even with the ban lifted  refugee admissions are expected to be far lower than in recent years. Last month   Trump  capped refugee admissions at 45 000 for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1  a cut of more than half from the 110 000 limit put in place the year earlier by President Barack Obama. And the actual number admitted this year could be far lower than  Trump 's 45 000 cap  which sets a maximum but not a minimum.
During his presidential campaign   Trump  pledged to ""stop the massive inflow of refugees"" and warned that terrorists were smuggling themselves into naive countries by posing as refugees fleeing war-torn Syria.
""Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free health care  even as our own veterans  our great  great veterans  die while they're waiting online for medical care that they desperately need ""  Trump  said last October.

 Trump   who began raising funds for  his  re-election on the day  he  was sworn in  led the way.  His  campaign spent more than $688 000 at  Trump  properties. The largest amount: more than $476 000 to Trump Tower in New York for rent expenses.  The presidentâs  2020 campaign headquarters are housed at  his  midtown Manhattan skyscraper.
 Trumpâs Washington  hotel  which opened during the height of the 2016 campaign  took in $351 000 last year with more than 60% of that coming from the Republican National Committee to host events at the property not far from the White House.

Shuster  the chairman of the House Transportation Committee  announced last month that he âs  retiring at year âs  end.
When he took office   Trump  formally resigned his positions with hundreds of companies in his far-flung real estate and branding empire and handed over management to his adult sons and a veteran Trump Organization executive. But he broke with presidential tradition by refusing to relinquish ownership of his companies. As a result  spending at  Trump  properties still can benefit the presidentâs bottom line.

5310,Trump taking tougher stance on Russia nuclear threat,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â The  Trump  administration on Friday announced it will continue much of the Obama administrationâs nuclear weapons policy  but take a more aggressive stance toward Russia. It said Russia must be convinced it would face âunacceptably dire costsâ if it were to threaten even a limited nuclear attack in Europe.
The sweeping review of U.S. nuclear policy does not call for any net increase in strategic nuclear weapons â a position that stands in contrast to  President Donald Trumpâs statement  in a tweet  shortly before  he  took office  that the U.S. âmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.â In his State of the Union address Tuesday  he made no mention of expansion  though he said the arsenal must deter acts of aggression.
The Pentagon-led review of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and the policies that govern it was ordered by  Trump  a year ago. In a written statement   Trump  said U.S. strategy is designed to make use of nuclear weapons less likely. In an apparent reference to the threat of catastrophic cyberattack   he  said the U.S. aims to strengthen deterrence of major attacks against the U.S. and its allies  including those that âmay not come in the form of nuclear weapons.â
â President Trump  is embarking on a reckless path â one that will reduce U.S. security both now and in the longer term â said Lisbeth Gronlund  a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. She said the administration is blurring the line between nuclear and conventional war-fighting.
The  Trump  administration concluded that the U.S. should largely follow its predecessorâs blueprint for modernizing the nuclear arsenal  including new bomber aircraft  submarines and land-based missiles. It also endorsed adhering to existing arms control agreements  including the New START treaty that limits the United States and Russia each to 1 550 strategic nuclear warheads on a maximum of 700 deployed launchers.
The  Trump  nuclear doctrine breaks with Obamaâs in ending his push to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. defense policy. Like Obama   Trump  would consider using nuclear weapons only in âextreme circumstances â while maintaining a degree of ambiguity about what that means. But  Trump  sees a fuller deterrent role for these weapons  as reflected in the plan to develop new capabilities to counter Russia in Europe.","WASHINGTON (AP) â The  Trump  administration on Friday announced it will continue much of the Obama administrationâs nuclear weapons policy  but take a more aggressive stance toward Russia.

5311,U.S. officials urge Iran to stop blocking social,Trump,"The Trump administration  accused the Iranian government Tuesday of blocking or suppressing communications used by anti-government protesters and began laying groundwork for new international sanctions targeting alleged human rights abuses.
As the protests continued for the sixth day   the Trump administration  attempted to grasp whether discontent would spiral into a full-fledged uprising or be smothered in government suppression. The demonstrations began over economic grievances but quickly turned political as people in cities and towns around the nation chanted broadly anti-government slogans.
U.S. officials from the White House  the State Department and the United Nations hastened to respond  calling for Tehran to respect its citizensâ rights to protest peacefully while suggesting the government could be responsible for a death toll that rose to more than 20. In preparation   the administration  began rallying support for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting that could condemn Iran or consider human rights sanctions on Iranian government officials.
The protests are presenting  President Trump  with a test of  his  vow to adopt a tougher posture in dealing with Iran than  his  predecessor did. The unrest also confronts the  Trump  administration with the dilemma of how far to go in advocating the demise of a clerical regime that has been a sworn enemy of Washington for nearly 40 years.
âThe people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime â  Trump  tweeted Tuesday. âAll of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their âpockets.â The people have little food  big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!â
That was a reference to  the 2015 international nuclear deal negotiated under President Barack Obama  which Trump has called a giveaway to a thuggish theocracy and the âworst dealâ imaginable for the United States .
Despite protests from important allies and the opposition of key members of his national security cabinet   Trump  undermined  the deal  in October by refusing to give a presidential endorsement required by Congress.  He  faces another such decision this month  and is again expected to withhold certification and leave  the deal  in limbo.  He  may order new U.S. sanctions over human rights abuses in suppressing the protests  a move that would not require agreement at the United Nations.
The administration is casting its response to the protests as in keeping with its tougher approach and critique of  the nuclear deal  as weak and naive. U.S. officials are especially trying to paint a contrast between  Trump âs support for street protests and Obamaâs reaction to more overtly political protests in 2009.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders avoided a direct answer on whether the United States wants to see the Iranian government fall  or whether Trump would help toward that end.

5314,Barack Obama to Prince Harry: Leaders must use care on social media,Barack Obama,"Former President Barack Obama  told Prince Harry in an interview broadcast Wednesday that people in leadership roles must be careful in their use of social media and warned against spending too much time immersed in the internet at the expense of the world outside.
 Obama  did not  however  directly mention  his  successor  President Donald Trump  who has made the use of Twitter a centerpiece of  his  presidency.
""All of us in leadership have to find ways to recreate a common space on the internet ""  he  said. ""One of the dangers of the internet is people can have entirely different realities. They can be just cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases.""
 He  spoke with Harry in the prince's capacity as guest editor of the BBC Radio 4 news program. Both men said the interview  recorded in Canada in September  was  Obama 's first since leaving the presidency in January.
 Obama  said  he  felt serene the day  he  left the White House at the end of  his  second four-year term despite the vast amount of work that remained unfinished.  He  said it was ""hugely liberating"" to be able to set  his  own agenda in the morning to have the time to talk with  his  wife  Michelle  now that  he  is no longer president.
""I miss the work itself because it was fascinating  "" Obama  said of  his  eight years in the Oval Office  citing  his  health care reforms as one of  his  proudest achievements.
In a brief live segment at the end of the show  Harry said he did not know if  Obama  would be on the guest list for his wedding in May to American actress Meghan Markle.
The prince used his position to ask  Obama  a ""lightning round"" of questions of the type normally asked of entertainers  not politicians.
 The former president  declined to say whether  he  wears boxers or briefs  preserving a bit of post-presidential dignity  but was willing to say  he  prefers Aretha Franklin to Tina Turner â ""Aretha is the best ""  he  said of the Queen of Soul â and favors retired basketball star Michael Jordan over current phenom LeBron James.
 Obama  rejected gloomy prognostications about the state of the world  saying that in many ways the world is healthier and wealthier than it has ever been  making it perhaps the best time in human history to be born.
 He  cited improved treatment of African-Americans and greatly expanded opportunities for young women as achievements of the past few generations that give  him  hope for the future.","[TGT] told Prince Harry in an interview broadcast Wednesday that people in leadership roles must be careful in their use of social media and warned against spending too much time immersed in the internet at the expense of the world outside.

5316,Trump confirms big change to Israel policy Jerusalem 'off the table',Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  confirmed a big change to US policy on Israel while speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Davos  Switzerland  on Thursday.
""We took Jerusalem off the table  "" Trump  said.
 Trump  used similar language in a series of tweets earlier in January.
 President Donald Trump  doubled down Thursday on a change to the US's approach to Middle East peace while speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Davos  Switzerland  at the World Economic Forum.
""We took Jerusalem off the table  "" Trump  said. ""So we don't have to talk about it anymore.""
It was unclear from  Trump 's televised remarks whether  he  was merely doubling down on or also expanding the shift in US policy on Israel  he  announced in a landmark speech in December. In those remarks   Trump  recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said the US would be moving its embassy in the country there from Tel Aviv.
 Trump  has suggested  he  hopes to move the Israeli-Palestinian peace process forward by removing the status of the holy city as a debatable issue.
""You won one point  and you'll give up some points later in the negotiation  if there's ever a negotiation  "" Trump  told Netanyahu on Thursday.
Some analysts  however  interpreted  Trump 's latest words as signaling a new unwillingness to negotiate the borders of Jerusalem  as the Palestinians generally seek East Jerusalem as their capital in a two-state solution to the conflict.
 Trump  used similar language as  he  did Thursday in a series of tweets earlier in January.
""We pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don't even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel  "" Trump  tweeted. ""We have taken Jerusalem  the toughest part of the negotiation  off the table  but Israel  for that  would have had to pay more.""
 Trump  on Thursday said  he  believed US aid payments to Palestine were still ""on the table"" for negotiations.
The US has yet to present its much-discussed peace plan for the Middle East  but  Trump  said Thursday: ""It's a great proposal for the Palestinians. I think it's a very good proposal for Israel.""
Both recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the US Embassy were among  Trump 's campaign promises and change decades of US policy in the Middle East.
Notably  however   Trump  said then that the US was not ruling out future changes to borders.
""We are not taking a position of any final status issues including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders ""  Trump  said in the December speech. ""Those questions are up to the parties involved."""," [TGT] confirmed a big change to US policy on Israel while speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Davos  Switzerland  on Thursday.

""We have taken Jerusalem  the toughest part of the negotiation  off the table  but Israel  for that  would have had to pay more.""
  [TGT] on Thursday said   [TGT]   believed US aid payments to Palestine were still ""on the table"" for negotiations.
The US has yet to present its much-discussed peace plan for the Middle East  but   [TGT]   said Thursday: ""It's a great proposal for the Palestinians. I think it's a very good proposal for Israel.""
Both recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the US Embassy were among   [TGT]  's campaign promises and change decades of US policy in the Middle East.
Notably  however    [TGT] said then that the US was not ruling out future changes to borders.
""We are not taking a position of any final status issues including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders ""   [TGT]   said in the December speech.

 Donald Trump  bragged in vulgar terms about kissing  groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone  saying that âwhen youâre a star  they let you do it â according to a video obtained by The Washington Post.
The video captures  Trump  talking with Billy Bush  then of âAccess Hollywood â on a bus with the showâs name written across the side. They were arriving on the set of âDays of Our Livesâ to tape a segment about  Trump âs cameo on the soap opera.
Late Friday night  following sharp criticism by Republican leaders   Trump  issued a short video statement saying  âI said it  I was wrong  and I apologize.â But  he  also called the revelation âa distraction from the issues we are facing today.â  He  said that  his  âfoolishâ words are much different than the words and actions of Bill Clinton  whom  he  accused of abusing women  and Hillary Clinton  whom  he  accused of having âbullied  attacked  shamed and intimidated  his  victims.â
âIâve never said Iâm a perfect person  nor pretended to be someone that Iâm not. Iâve said and done things I regret  and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words donât reflect who I am â  Trump  said.
In an apparent response to Republican critics asking  him  to drop out of the race   he  said: âWe will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday. â

The tape includes audio of Bush and  Trump  talking inside the bus  as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment.
In that audio   Trump  discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman  whose full name is not given in the video.
âI moved on her  and I failed. Iâll admit it â  Trump  is heard saying. It was unclear when the events  he  was describing took place. The tape was recorded several months after  he  married  his  third wife  Melania.
âI did try and f--- her. She was married â  Trump  says.
 Trump  continues: âAnd I moved on her very heavily. In fact  I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said  âIâll show you where they have some nice furniture.ââ
âI moved on her like a bitch  but I couldnât get there. And she was married â  Trump  says. âThen all of a sudden I see her  sheâs now got the big phony tits and everything. Sheâs totally changed her look.â

5318,Trump delivers unhinged rant on NFL calls Colin Kaepernick a âson of a bitchâ â ThinkProgress,Trump,"During a 90-minute speech in Alabama  purportedly to support Senator Luther Strange who faces a special primary election next Tuesday   Trump  diverted into an extended rant on the NFL.
âWouldnât you love to see one of these NFL owners  when somebody disrespects our flag  to say  âget that son of a bitch off the field right now. He is fired. Heâs fired! 'â  Trump  shouted to a cheering audience.
 Trump  has taken credit for Kaepernickâs inability to find work. âIt was reported that NFL owners donât want to pick him up because they donât want to get a nasty tweet from  Donald Trump  â  Trump  told a cheering crowd in Kentucky this July. âDo you believe that? I just saw that. I just saw that.â
In Alabama on Friday   Trump  suggested that any fan who sees a player take a knee during an NFL game should âleave the stadiumâ¦pick up and leave.â He said that people wouldnât be missing much anyway since the league has made modest efforts aimed at avoiding debilitating brain injuries. âThey are ruining the game â  Trump  said.
During the campaign   Trump  said that Kaepernick âshould find a country that works better for him.â
Kaepernick has called  Trump  âopenly racist.â
Last week  the White House called on ESPN to fire SportsCenter anchor Jemele Hill after  she  tweeted that  Trump  was a white supremacist.

5319,Vulgar remark removes all doubt: Trump is a racist,Trump,"OK  can we finally stop beating around the bush and say outright that  President Donald Trump  is a white supremacist?
In a story first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by NBC News   Trump  was speaking to lawmakers Thursday when  he  angrily slammed their desire to restore protections for refugees from Haiti  El Salvador and some African countries.
 Trump  was balking at an immigration deal that would include protections for people from Haiti and some nations in Africa. Instead  according to reports   Trump  expressed a preference for immigrants from places like Norway  whose prime minister he welcomed a day earlier â and which also happens to be one of the worldâs whitest countries.
After a night of broadcasters debating whether to quote Trumpâs vulgarity out loud or bleep it  on Friday morning  Trump  tweeted a denial that  he  had used such language at all  although Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin  an Illinois Democrat  and other witnesses confirmed the reported words.
âI have a wonderful relationship with Haitians â  Trump  tweeted. âProbably should record future meetings â unfortunately  no trust!â
 Trump himself  has helped spread poisonous stereotypes since the day  he  launched  his  presidential campaign by calling Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission ârapistsâ and âmurderers â even though  he  allowed that âsome  I presume  are good people.â More than âsome â Mr. President.
Remember how ESPN anchor Jemele Hill fell into hot water in September for calling  Trump  a âwhite supremacistâ on air? I thought she sounded too extreme at that time  but now? Her time has come.
Yet the White House was slow to back away from  Trumpâs  reported remarks  according to some reports  because  Team Trump  figures the hostile edge to his âAmerica Firstâ policy plays well with  his  cherished base. Indeed   Trumpâs  hunger for applause from  his  base at rallies or on Fox News has led  him  to pander persistently to that far-right minority while thumbing  his  nose at the rest of us.
How can we forget  his  rise as a candidate after questioning the validity of President Barack Obamaâs birth certificate  branding Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals  calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and responding very slo-o-owly to disavow the support of the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke?
Since then   Trump âs polarizing politics have fed widespread doubts about  President Trumpâs mental fitness   even before  Michael Wolffâs  runaway best-seller âFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White Houseâ raised new questions. A January Quinnipiac University poll found a slim majority of American voters (53 percent to 44 percent) say he is intelligent  but 69 percent say heâs not level-headed and 57 percent say he is not fit to serve as president.
But  as  Trump  has shown  you donât have to be mentally ill to play on fears and promote white supremacy.","OK  can we finally stop beating around the bush and say outright that   [TGT] is a white supremacist?

5320,Trump Says Program To Protect Dreamers Is 'Probably Dead ' Blames Democrats,Trump,"Trump  has said  he  would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  or DACA  and  his  Twitter comments on Sunday came as lawmakers worked on a bipartisan compromise on immigration policy.
âDACA is probably dead because the Democrats donât really want it  they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military â  Trump  said on Twitter. But  he  left a door open that a deal could be reached with Democrats in Congress.

5321,Newt Gingrich: Trump has just delivered two brilliant political surprises,Trump,"President Trump  has once again surprised the national establishment. This week  he  announced  his  re-election campaign earlier than any president in history. Simultaneously   he  announced Brad Parscale would be  his  campaign manager.
Both these moves are a reminder of how intuitive and strategic  Donald J. Trump  is. These qualities are a big part of why  he  was elected to be our 45th president.
First   President Trump  is saying to any potential Republican challengers: âI will crush you.â The amount of money  he  will raise  the scale of the organization that  he  will build  and the size of the pro-Trump base will all combine to make the possibility of a viable Republican challenger an absurdity. Someone can run  but he or she will never survive the first round of primaries.
 Trump  knows that a strong campaign for Republicans in 2018 will earn them six to 10 Senate seats  while a weak strategy could result in no gain or only one or two new seats.
 President Trump  is also signaling to those who fantasize about a third-party candidate (and this number may grow as the Democratsâ civil war gets more vicious) that  he  will have the resources and the organizational base to totally dominate the general election.
Second   President Trump  is building a new Republican Party  which is much broader than the party that existed when  he  announced  his  candidacy in 2015. The presidentâs new  larger party is the one that carried Pennsylvania  Michigan and Wisconsin in the presidential election â and almost carried Minnesota. It was this larger party that turned Ohio from a competitive battlefield into a Republican landslide.
Americaâs rising prosperity will further broaden and deepen the Republican Party.  Trump  economics will be defined as the economics of more jobs  higher wages  lower taxes  more take-home pay and the vision of a prosperous America as the new normal.
There is one more big reason for  President Trump  announcing  his  re-election now: the 2018 elections.
 The president  knows how big a disaster Rep. Nancy Pelosi  D-Calif.  would be if she moves from her current post as House minority leader to become speaker of the House.  He  has developed a good relationship with Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  and  he  will go all out to help keep Republican control of the House.
 President Trump  also knows that a strong campaign for Republicans in 2018 will earn them six to 10 Senate seats  while a weak strategy could result in no gain or only one or two new seats.
 President Trump  knows that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  R-Ky.  has had a brutal time dealing with the 51-49 Republican majority in the Senate. Every victory remains a miracle. This is the year when the accident of geography puts a lot of Democratic seats in play. A Republican wave election would do the trick to ensure a long-lasting Republican majority.
Parscale was the digital strategy genius of the 2016 campaign. He built the  Trump  campaignâs huge Facebook system. He helped grow the enormous Twitter following. He was able to analyze  target and track enormous amounts of data.
Parscaleâs targeted data system enabled campaign staff to reach so many people that they routinely turned out thousands at  Trump  rallies with only a few daysâ notice.

 President Donald Trump  is again thanking the president of the Philippines  Rodrigo Duterte (doo-TEHRâ-tay)  for hosting world leaders at the annual ASEAN summit.

5324,Trump's North Korea Tweets Aren't Going To Lead To Nuclear War. Just Stop.,Trump,"On Tuesday night   an apparently-bored President Trump  took to Twitter to drop some hot takes on North Korea and the media. Hereâs what  he  tweeted  sending the media into paroxysms of orgasmic faux-panic:
North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the âNuclear Button is on  his  desk at all times.â Will someone from  his  depleted and food starved regime please inform  him  that I too have a Nuclear Button  but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than  his   and my Button works! â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3  2018
This prompted absolute in-the-background-of-a-Kevin-Bacon-shot-Animal-House-style panic from the mainstream media. John Heilemann stated on Morning Joe on MSNBC that the tweets made  Trump  seem âdemented and deranged.â Jimmy Kimmel stated that âwe have two maniacs with nuclear warheads bragging about who has the bigger button.â
Itâs not tweets like this that will make a difference to American foreign policy  just as it made no difference in American foreign policy when Reagan joked about nuking the Soviet Union. What would make a difference would be  Trump  signaling friendship or apathy about an unfriendly state making aggressive moves. Those states might feel comfortable going to war  knowing that  Trump  tends to bluff about the use of force anyway. I wrote this back in March 2017:
Words matter. In 1990  U.S. ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie reportedly told Saddam Hussein that the U.S. wouldnât intervene if Hussein moved on Kuwait; foreign policy analysts have theorized that these words helped cement Husseinâs decision to invade...when Trumpian conspiracism bleeds over into foreign policy  that has actual consequences abroad. When  Trump  refuses to condemn Vladimir Putinâs human rights record  that matters â it emboldens Putin.
But  Trump  mouthing off about North Korea isnât  him  appeasing states on Twitter. Itâs the opposite. Itâs  him  blustering. That may be off-putting. It may make people uneasy. But itâs not going to lead to nuclear war  so everyone should calm down.

â He âs doubling down with  his  base â  she  continued. âAnd when it comes time to talk to  his  base  to galvanize them   he  hits with topics that really resonate with them: the Confederacy  issues of race â¦ the NFL with taking a knee â¦ [the] Charlottesville [rioting].â
Then Ryan described what she saw as Trumpâs âforgotten manâ base  describing its members as âthe uneducated or those who have not attended collegeâ as well as the âwhite male who feels â¦ on the fringe and not touched by any form of government.

5326,Trump met with Kevin Warsh as part of Fed chair search,Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â  President Donald Trump  met with former Federal Reserve board member Kevin Warsh as part of the process of interviewing candidates for the Fed's top job.
A White House official said  Trump  and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin met with Warsh on Thursday. The official spoke Friday on condition of anonymity to discuss private White House meetings.
 Trump  has said previously that  he  is considering re-nominating Fed Chair Janet Yellen when  her  term ends in February. But  he  has said  he  is also looking at other candidates including Gary Cohn  the head of  Trump 's National Economic Council.
Warsh  who served on the Fed's board from 2006 to 2011  was a key adviser to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke during the 2008 financial crisis. He is married to Jane Lauder  granddaughter of cosmetics giant Estee Lauder. Her father  Ronald Lauder is a longtime  Trump  friend.
 Trump  told reporters earlier this month that  he  liked and respected Yellen but had not made a decision yet on the Fed job. While  Trump  was harshly critical during the campaign of Yellen's performance   he  has made only favorable comments about  her  since the election.
Yellen's current term as chair expires on Feb. 3. In an interview this summer   Trump  mentioned Cohn as another candidate for the Fed job. But Cohn's prospects appeared to dim after he was publicly critical in August of  Trump 's response to the protest violence in Charlottesville  Virginia.
Yellen  asked last week whether she had met with  Trump  recently  said she had not met with the president since a brief discussion the two had after  Trump  took office. Yellen has repeatedly said she plans to serve out her current term. But she has not said whether she would serve another four-year term is asked to so do by  Trump .
At present there are three vacancies on the Fed board  and there will soon be a fourth. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer announced earlier this month that he planned to step down in October. So far   Trump  has moved to fill only one of the vacancies  nominating Utah financier Randal Quarles to the Fed board to be vice chairman for bank supervision. His nomination is pending before the Senate.","WASHINGTON (AP) â   [TGT] met with former Federal Reserve board member Kevin Warsh as part of the process of interviewing candidates for the Fed's top job.

In December  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told both states it would cut off some of the federal funding for the programs because Congress had not appropriated money for them  according to  the lawsuit .

5328,Mueller Team to Interview Nunberg Thursday Source Says,Donald Trump,"Why Mueller Is Seen as the Perfect Man for  the Job
Former Donald Trump political adviser Sam Nunberg  will be interviewed by the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election on Thursday  a person familiar with the matter said.
 Nunberg  will meet with a member of Special Counsel Robert Muellerâs team in Washington  said the person  who spoke on condition of anonymity. Itâs not clear what Mueller wants to speak with him about. Muellerâs office has informed him that heâs not a target of the probe and wonât be prosecuted unless heâs found to have lied to investigators  the person said.
 Nunberg  was on Trumpâs payroll from mid-2011 to August 2015. A possible line of questioning could regard Trumpâs activities in Moscow during the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that the president once owned.
 Nunberg  was fired from Trumpâs campaign in August 2015 after Business Insider published a story about  his  racially-charged Facebook posts. In July 2016   Trump  sued  him  for violating a confidentiality agreement. The suit was dropped the following month.
Author Michael Wolff repeatedly quoted  Nunberg  in âFire and Fury â his portrait of the early months of the  Trump  administration that was published in January. He said the former adviser was âgenerally regarded as the man who understood Trumpâs whims and impulses bestâ and an associate of Trumpâs former strategist  Steve Bannon.

5329,President Trump is losing control,Trump,"President Trump  continues to insist the Democrats are responsible for any story relating to Russian interference in the 2016 election despite a year's worth of evidence to the contrary. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIâs investigation  and the Russia scandal in general  are driving  this president  around the bend  to the point where  he  is setting  himself  against not just the government  he  leads but also the interests of the United States of America. And everything weâve seen up to now suggests that it will only get worse.
Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker described  President Trumpâs  weekend:
In a string of 10 Twitter messages â which began after 11 p.m. Saturday and ended around noon Sunday  and which included profanity and misspellings â  Trump  opened a window into  his  state of mind  even as  Trumpâs  representatives at a global security conference in Germany advised jittery allies to generally ignore  the president âs tweets.  Trump âs latest attacks built on remarks last week in which  he  misrepresented the evidence revealed by Mueller.  He  tweeted falsely  âI never said Russia did not meddle in the election.â  He  blamed President Barack Obamaâs administration for doing ânothingâ to stop the intrusion.  Trump  rebuked national security adviser H.R. McMaster for publicly saying the evidence of Russian interference was âincontrovertible.â And  he  held the FBI responsible for last weekâs devastating shooting at a Parkland  Fla.  high school that left 17 dead.  Trump  tweeted that the bureau was committing so many resources to the Russia probe that it missed âall of the many signalsâ about the shooter.
But  Trump  brings everything back to  himself . If the FBI made a mistake anywhere  it can only be because itâs out to get  Trump . Thereâs no issue â not even the murder of 17 people  most of them teenagers â that he wonât make about him. Thatâs why heâs so obsessed with the media  much more than the substance of any issue at hand: Itâs the one place where heâs always the story and always the star.
One of the most remarkable aspects of the Russia affair is that it would be so easy for  Trump  to act like something resembling a responsible president of the United States. He could simply say that whatever effect Russian meddling had on the 2016 election  it was unacceptable and the integrity of American elections must not be compromised. Then he could direct someone like Vice President Pence to lead a task force to make recommendations on how to secure elections in the future from both hacking and foreign propaganda efforts. Everyone would say that heâs doing the right thing  and he wouldnât look so paranoid  dishonest and defensive.
So at a moment when his own appointees atop the nationâs intelligence agencies are urgently warning that Russia is preparing to meddle in the 2018 and 2020 elections  their boss is all but telling them to stand down. No matter what Russia does   Trump  wonât ever be willing to deal with the problem  because  he âll always feel that doing so will only validate  his  critics. Do you think  Russian President Vladimir Putin  knows that? I suspect  he  does.
Itâs possible that various agencies of the government will  in spite of  the president   manage to take reasonably effective steps to minimize the effects of Russian efforts to subvert our elections. But  Putin  must realize that  he  neednât worry about anything that might require presidential approval  such as retaliatory actions aimed at punishing Russia for its assault on American democracy. That  we can be sure  isnât going to happen as long as  Trump  is president. You donât have to believe  he âs being blackmailed or that  he âs Putinâs puppet; all you need to know is that any admission of the truth of what happened in 2016 is intolerable for  him .
We also should understand that whatever effort Russia makes at interfering in the 2018 elections will be happening at the same time as the Mueller investigation is reaching its critical point  which will make  Trump  even more resistant to doing anything about Russian meddling. As Mueller issues more indictments   Trump  is certain to become angrier  more self-absorbed and more insistent that  his  great victory was pure and unsullied. This is a man who as of yesterday was still tweeting that âthe Democrats  lead by their fearless leader  Crooked Hillary Clinton  lost the 2016 election. But wasnât I a great candidate?â
With each new step Mueller takes   Trump  will react by saying that none of itâs true and itâs all a conspiracy against  him . When  his  aides tell  him  about some new Russian intrusion   he âll ask not whatâs necessary to defend the country  but how the whole thing is going to make  him  look. As  he  also tweeted yesterday  âThey are laughing their asses off in Moscow.â At least  he  got that right.

We also should understand that whatever effort Russia makes at interfering in the 2018 elections will be happening at the same time as the Mueller investigation is reaching its critical point  which will make   [TGT] even more resistant to doing anything about Russian meddling. As Mueller issues more indictments    [TGT] is certain to become angrier  more self-absorbed and more insistent that  his  great victory was pure and unsullied. This is a man who as of yesterday was still tweeting that âthe Democrats  lead by their fearless leader  Crooked Hillary Clinton  lost the 2016 election. But wasnât I a great candidate?â
With each new step Mueller takes    [TGT] will react by saying that none of itâs true and itâs all a conspiracy against  him . When  his  aides tell  him  about some new Russian intrusion   he âll ask not whatâs necessary to defend the country  but how the whole thing is going to make  him  look. As  he  also tweeted yesterday  âThey are laughing their asses off in Moscow.â At least  he  got that right.

 President Donald Trump  blasted NBC News in a tweet on Wednesday after the outlet reported that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the president a âmoron.â
âNBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN â  Trump  tweeted. âThey are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!â
NBC News had reported that Tillerson disparaged the president after a meeting on Afghanistan in which  Trump  compared âthe decision-making process on troop levels to the renovation of a high-end New York restaurant.â The news outlet also reported that Tillerson had considered resigning.
As Business Insiderâs Joe Perticone noticed   Trump âs social media director Dan Scavino sent an identical tweet at the same moment  suggesting that  Trump  himself might not have written the tweet.
Tillerson addressed the story on Wednesday in a public address  saying  he  was committed to the president and to his role as secretary of state and trying to dispel the notion that he wanted to leave the post. He also denied that Vice President Mike Pence intervened to persuade him to stay in the job.
âIâm not going to deal with petty stuff like that â Tillerson said when asked about NBC Newsâ reporting that claimed he called  Trump  a âmoron.â

Daniels  whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  believes that  Trump  attorney Michael Cohen invalidated a non-disclosure agreement after two news stories were published Tuesday: One  in which  Cohen  told The New York Times that  he  made the six-figure payment with  his  personal funds  and another in the Daily Beast  which reported that  Cohen  was shopping a book proposal that would touch on Danielsâ story  said the manager  Gina Rodriguez.
Daniels first detailed her account of an alleged extramarital affair with  Trump  in 2011  when the celebrity website The Dirty published it but then removed the material under the threat of a lawsuit  according to the siteâs founder  Nik Richie.
 Michael Cohen    Trumpâs  âpit bull â comes to bossâ aid again
In January  The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited liability company in Delaware formed by  Cohen  made the six-figure payment to Daniels to keep her from discussing the affair during the presidential campaign.
 Cohen  said Tuesday the payment was made with  his  own money  and that âneither the Trump Organization nor the  Trump  campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford  and neither reimbursed me for the payment  either directly or indirectly.â

5332,Trump reversed flooding regulations days before Hurricane Harvey,Trump,"Ten days before Hurricane Harvey descended upon Texas on Friday  wreaking havoc and causing widespread flooding   President Donald Trump  signed an executive order revoking a set of regulations that would have made federally funded infrastructure less vulnerable to flooding.
But because of  Trump 's rollback of President Barack Obama's Federal Flood Risk Management Standard  experts across the political spectrum say much of the federal money sent to Texas is likely to be wasted on construction that will insufficiently protect against the next storm.
Lehrer called  Trump 's decision to revoke the standards ""the biggest step backwards that has ever been taken in flood-management policy"" and said the move would waste taxpayer money  harm the environment  and cost lives.
He and others argue that Trump's decision was a politically motivated attempt to undo Obama's climate-change legacy.
And while Trump justified the rollback as part of an attempt to streamline and speed up construction projects  Lehrer said the regulations' effect on the construction process would have been largely ""subtle and inexpensive"" and that an insignificant number of projects would have been abandoned because of increased costs.","Ten days before Hurricane Harvey descended upon Texas on Friday  wreaking havoc and causing widespread flooding    [TGT] signed an executive order revoking a set of regulations that would have made federally funded infrastructure less vulnerable to flooding.

5334,Trump talks Dems' memo guns and border wall in exclusive interview with Fox News,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  urged  the nation  âto all come togetherâ Saturday night as  he  discussed the Democrats' FISA rebuttal memo  potential new gun legislation and plans for a border wall in an exclusive interview with Fox News.
Speaking with Jeanine Pirro  host of ""Justice with Judge Jeanine  "" Trump  said the Democrats' FISA rebuttal memo âverifiedâ the contents of Republican U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes' memo  which was released previously.
 The president  asserted that that was likely the reason why Democrats didnât push hard for their own memo to be released.
Pirro noted that months of investigation into possible ties between the Russians and the  Trump  campaign and administration have not led to any âreference of collusion.â
âThere is no collusion â  Trump  replied.
âI don't want to sound braggadocious  but I was a far better candidate than [Hillary Clinton]. ... Frankly  that's what it was all about. It was nothing to do with Russians â  he  said.
âI don't want to sound braggadocious  but I was a far better candidate than [Hillary Clinton]. ... Frankly  that's what it was all about. It was nothing to do with Russians.â - President Donald Trump
When asked about Twitter comments by U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff  D-Calif.  ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee and a harsh critic of the president   Trump  responded by calling for national unity rather than division.
âI think that Iâve had a lot of good ideas and I have a lot of energy. I get things done â  Trump  said.
 Trump  added that the Republicans' tax cut bill -- signed into law in December -- was a key reason why  his  approval ratings were high  but suggested that cuts in regulations may have been even more popular.
âI donât think any administration has done as much as weâve done in the first year  I donât think itâs even close â  Trump  said.
 He  also spoke about gun regulation in wake of the Feb. 14 massacre in Parkland  Fla.
âIâve spoke to many senators  many congressman ... and I think weâre going to have a great bill put forward very soon having to do with background checks â  Trump  said.
But  he  added there was âno bigger champion of the Second Amendmentâ protecting the rights of gun owners than  him  -- and reiterated  his  stance that teachers should be able to protect schools through with âconcealed [carry] permits.â
 Trump  said that assuring gun purchasers' mental stability would also be a strong part of improving background checks.

5335,VP Pence Draws Applause Some Heckles For U.S. Embassy Move To Jerusalem : Parallels : NPR,Trump,"Pence announced the new timetable in a speech before the Knesset  Israel's parliament  drawing a standing ovation from Israeli lawmakers and accelerating one of  the Trump administration 's most contentious foreign policy decisions to date.
""In the weeks ahead   our administration  will advance  its  plan to open the United States Embassy in Jerusalem â and that United States Embassy will open before the end of next year "" Pence said.
When  President Trump  last month appeared before cameras and announced the U.S. was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and beginning to prepare for a new embassy in the city  Pence stood behind  Trump  â in more ways than one.
As a devout Christian and an ardent supporter of Israel  Pence was one of the biggest advocates for the move as the  Trump  administration debated the decision.
But instead of allowing the parties to move on  it has led to a crisis in U.S.-Palestinian relations â the lowest point in  the Trump administration 's months of shuttle diplomacy and attempts to restart the peace process.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas says the U.S. sided with Israel and that he will not participate in peace negotiations led by the United States.  Trump  tweeted that if the Palestinians were not prepared to negotiate  the U.S. should cut funding for them.
Indeed   the administration  subsequently cut $65 million in funds to a U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees but said  it  was meant to encourage reform in the agency  not as punishment.
In a rambling and fiery speech  Abbas directed a colloquial Arabic phrase at  Trump  â literally ""may your house be destroyed"" â that is often used casually but was widely criticized by Israeli leaders and seen as brash rhetoric directed at a foreign leader.
Meeting with European Union foreign envoys in Brussels  Abbas said the Palestinians would participate in peace talks only if they were held with the involvement of other countries  not just the United States. Abbas sees European countries as more favorable than  the Trump administration  to the Palestinians.
Opposition lawmakers stood and applauded  but not Netanyahu. Many members of his right-wing coalition reject a two-state solution. Since  Trump 's election  many in the Israeli government have called for annexing parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank where Israeli settlements are located and where Palestinians want to establish a state.
Israel has refrained from such an annexation since capturing the territory 50 years ago  fearing international and American backlash  but many lawmakers believe the time to do it is now â with  a sympathetic President Trump in the White House . The  Trump  administration has been much more tolerant of Israeli West Bank settlements than have previous U.S. administrations  Republican and Democratic alike.","Pence announced the new timetable in a speech before the Knesset  Israel's parliament  drawing a standing ovation from Israeli lawmakers and accelerating one of  the Trump administration 's most contentious foreign policy decisions to date.

5336,The Trump Tax Cut Isn't Trickling Down to Workers,Trump,"Walmart was one of several companies touting bonuses  but other companies have laid off workers.  Trump  photo by Alex Wong/Getty  Walmart photo by Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty
 Donald Trump  spent a good portion of  his  Tuesday night State of the Union speech celebrating the American economy  and  his  tax cuts in particularâwhich  he  falsely called the âbiggest in history.â It was a big cut  however  and also the most significant piece of legislation passed by the Republican-dominated Congress in 2017. Unsurprisingly  the largest beneficiaries of this bill were the wealthy and corporations. Whatâs unclear  however  a little more than a month after the bill has passed  is how exactly this new cash influx will be spent.
 Trump  and  his  Republican allies want people to think that the bill will be a boost to workers. The passage of the cuts was quickly followed by a slew of corporate press releases  more than 70 in all  announcing employee bonuses. Walmart gave âeligible associatesâ (meaning longtime workers) a cash bonus of âup to $1 000 â Apple gave employees $2 500 in restricted stock  and Disney gave $1 000 cash bonuses to 125 000 (out of 195 000) employees. In every case  corporations explicitly tied bonuses to the tax cut; Disney actually corrected a press release to emphasize the link.
That all added up to a massive PR campaign on behalf of the cuts that elided all of the billâs negative consequences  like the decision by Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark to use its tax windfall to fund a plan that included laying off 5 000 workers. And itâs not clear that the cut directly led to the bonuses or if the companies just credited Trump in order to garner goodwill from the administration. In AT&Tâs case  the telecom giant said it had given out $1 000 bonuses because of the tax cuts when actually it was pushed into handing out money by a union representing its workers.
According to those in favor of the tax cut  that would indeed be a way firms will use their tax breaks  and that could lead to more jobs. These wonât be the manufacturing jobs that Trump is so fond of  however. âThat labor is skilled labor  people who can do research  people with doctoral degrees â said Fich. âThat means maybe a little uptick on employment  but not the blue-collar workers. It might not even be your four-year-college-educated individuals.â
The biggest one was that  ironically  more companies kept even more cash offshore following the holiday. The mindset was simple: We missed the first holiday  so might as well wait until the next. But another effect hinted at what companies would do with an influx of money. Just as they've done immediately after the Trump tax cut  rather than invest in creating jobs they bought back debt and shares. (One study found that 94 cents of every dollar brought back went to share buybacks and dividends.)","Walmart was one of several companies touting bonuses  but other companies have laid off workers.

5337,Trump uses Colts linebacker's death to attack Democrats on immigration,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  on Tuesday used the death of an Indianapolis Colts linebacker to slam Democrats over immigration policy.
Edwin Jackson was killed by a vehicle driven by a twice-deported immigrant living illegally in the U.S.  according to reports.  Trump   in a Tuesday morning tweet  said that it was ""disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed"" the 26-year-old Colts defender.
 Trump  then tried to strike a more conciliatory tone with a tweet in which  he  offered ""prayers and best wishes"" for Jackson's family.
 The president 's latest immigration broadside against Democrats comes as lawmakers try to strike a deal to extend protections for people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. In return   Trump  has sought a package of stringent border-security enhancements and immigration limitations.
There is bipartisan support for extended protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  or DACA  program.  Trump  has signaled  his  willingness to compromise on the legislation  although  he  recently shot down a bipartisan immigration plan as a ""total waste of time."" Democrats have resisted  Trump 's more hard-line positions  such as a border wall.
 Trump  announced in September that  he  was ending the program and gave Congress until March 5 to reach a legislative solution.

5338,Trumpâs âtraitorâ rhetoric looms over Bowe Bergdahlâs sentencing,Trump,"The military judge who will decide whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl goes to prison for leaving his post in Afghanistan indicated Monday that President Trumpâs recent remarks on the case could raise doubts about the Army sergeantâs legal proceedings and whether they were fair.
But the court heard several sound bites from  Trump  as the judge  Army Col. Jeffrey R. Nance  sought to determine whether the presidentâs new comments affirmed his past statements about Bergdahl being a âdirty  rotten traitor.â
Speaking to reporters last week   Trump  declined to say whether  his  previous attacks on Bergdahl may have unfairly influenced the soldierâs decision to plead guilty. Yet  his  word choice â âBut I think people have heard my comments in the past â the president said â was the subject of debate between Nance and attorneys for the defense and prosecution. In 2015   Trump  also promised to review decisions made in the case if he were to become commander in chief.
Lead defense attorney Eugene Fidell filed  a motion saying Trumpâs latest comments build on his harsh campaign rhetoric and amount to unlawful command influence  thus compromising Bergdahlâs chances to receive a fair sentencing .  The motion  seeks to dismiss the case on those grounds.
Trumpâs comments reconfirmed  his  past statements and produced a âchilling effectâ on the military justice system  Fidell said â to such a degree that Nance should not impose jail time for Bergdahl.
âWords have meaning. And âbutâ means what?â Nance asked prosecutor Maj. Justin Oshana  who disputed Fidellâs assertion that  Trump  continues to hold such views about Bergdahl.
Nance had ruled in February that Trumpâs campaign remarks  while âdisturbing â did not amount to unlawful command influence. But he appears to be reconsidering.
âThe reasons [to dismiss earlier accusations] tend to be eroded when the now-president of the United States apparently adopts those past statements â Nance told the prosecutor. Nance added his interpretation of Trumpâs meaning to be: âI shouldnât comment on that  but I think everyone knows what I think on Bowe Bergdahl.â
Pressed further on  Trump âs verbiage  Oshana offered that the presidentâs words were ânot the best constructed â a statement that elicited stifled chuckles in the courtroom.
Oshana pointed to  a White House statement issued Friday that he characterized as evidence Trump has not sought to influence what punishment Bergdahl receives .

5343,President Trump Declares Major Reduction of Bears Ears Monument,Trump,"Environmentalists and some native tribes say  Mr. Trumpâs move  will destroy the national heritage and threaten some 100 000 sites of archaeological importance tucked into the monumentsâ desert landscapes. Conservative lawmakers and many Westerners argue that  the move  is the proper response to decades of federal overreach.
The announcement sparked immediate outcry from Mr. Trumpâs opponents.
âWhatâs next   President Trump â  said Rhea Suh  president of the Natural Resources Defense Council  âthe Grand Canyon?â
In April   the president  ordered the secretary of the interior  Ryan Zinke  to review 27 national monuments created since 1996  something  he  said would âend another egregious use of government power.â In August  Mr. Zinke delivered a report to the president suggesting that  Mr. Trump  change the boundaries of six of those monuments.
Americans on both sides of the aisle have anxiously awaited the decision. On Monday morning  hundreds of people gathered outside the State Capitol in cowboy hats to protest Mr. Trumpâs decision.
Further south  at the edge of the monument  another group had gathered to applaud Mr. Trumpâs decision over the weekend  standing beneath a banner: âThank you for listening to local voices.â
Mr. Trumpâs decision to reduce Bears Ears is viewed as a victory for Republican lawmakers  fossil fuel companies and others who argue that monument designations are federal land grabs that limit revenue and stifle local control. And it is considered a defeat for many environmentalists and recreation groups and for the five Indian nations who have fought for generations to protect the Bears Ears region.
Senator Mike Lee of Utah said  Mr. Trump âs decision would benefit  his  state. â He âs been sympathetic to our plight â  he  said of  the president . â He âs been sympathetic to the fact that weâve been mistreated  and Iâm grateful that  he  is willing to correct it.â
The federal government controls about two-thirds of the land in Utah  and the stateâs leading politicians have long pushed for more local control of public lands. In an interview  Gov. Gary Herbert  called Mr. Trumpâs move ânothing more than a realignment  a reconfiguration of the boundaries.â
 Mr. Trump  is not the first president to shrink a monument. Woodrow Wilson reduced Mount Olympus by half. Franklin Roosevelt cut the Grand Canyon monument at the behest of ranchers. (Both are now national parks.)
If  Mr. Trumpâs  legal challengers win in court  the decision could affirm future presidentsâ rights to use the Antiquities Act to extend protection to large areas of public land. And it could cement the boundaries of Bears Ears laid out by President Obama.
But if they lose  Mr. Trump and future presidents could drastically shrink any of the dozens of monuments created by their predecessors  opening the formerly protected terrain for all kinds of development.

5344,Congresswoman: Trump endangering NFL players with ârecklessâ comments about safety,Trump,"This is not the first time  President Trump  has appeared to underestimate the effects linked to repeated hits to the head. (Olivier Douliery/Pool via Bloomberg)
 President Trump  had an awful lot to say about the NFL this weekend â and not just about players who did not stand for the national anthem to protest racial injustice in the United States. Largely lost in the kerfuffle were comments  Trump  made suggesting the NFLâs player safety rules are âruining the game.â
âFifteen yards  throw  him  out of the game â  he  said at a Friday night rally in Alabama. âThey had that last week. I watched for a couple of minutes. Two guys  just really beautiful tackle  boom  15 yards. The referee gets on television   his  wife is sitting at home  sheâs so proud of  him  â theyâre ruining the game. Right? Theyâre ruining the game. Hey look  thatâs what they want to do. They want to hit  but it is hurting the game.â
On Tuesday  Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.)  a longtime advocate for player safety  shot back  deriding  Trump  for âencouraging increased violence in football.â
âThese comments endanger player safety and completely contradict extensive scientific study â Schakowsky said in  a letter to Trump   reminding him of the adverse health effects of concussions  which  Trump  did not mention Friday but has downplayed before.
âConcussions are much more than âa little ding on the head â as you said during your campaign â  she  wrote. âEven repeated and sub-concussive blows to the head  commonplace in football  have been shown to cause lasting neurodegenerative diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This serious disease includes symptoms of impulse control problems  aggression  depression and paranoia. As time passes  CTE continues to degenerate the brain  resulting in memory loss  confusion  impaired judgment and eventually progressive dementia.â
Attached to  the letter   Schakowsky included links to congressional testimony about concussions in sports  as well as a recent study that found an alarming rate of CTE in former NFL players.
[Steinberg: Donât let  Trump  turn NFL playersâ brains into a political football]
âIt is inexcusable to deride systemic efforts to improve player safety â Schakowsky wrote to  Trump   whose comments came a day after BUâs CTE Center diagnosed Aaron Hernandez  who committed suicide while serving a life sentence for murder in April  with one of the severest forms of CTE. âThere are real consequences for your reckless comments  and players will pay the price. The time for denying facts and looking the other way is over.â
 Compared to the widespread reactions Trump received from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and NFL owners  reaction to his Friday comments about public safety has been few and far between .  They  did elicit a response from Joe Lockhart  the NFL executive vice president of communications and public affairs  who called Trumpâs comments on safety âout of touch.â","This is not the first time   [TGT] has appeared to underestimate the effects linked to repeated hits to the head.

Largely lost in the kerfuffle were comments   [TGT] made suggesting the NFLâs player safety rules are âruining the game.â
âFifteen yards  throw   [TGT]   out of the game â   [TGT]   said at a Friday night rally in Alabama. âThey had that last week. I watched for a couple of minutes. Two guys  just really beautiful tackle  boom  15 yards. The referee gets on television    [TGT]   wife is sitting at home  sheâs so proud of   [TGT]   â theyâre ruining the game. Right? Theyâre ruining the game. Hey look  thatâs what they want to do. They want to hit  but it is hurting the game.â
On Tuesday  Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.)  a longtime advocate for player safety  shot back  deriding   [TGT] for âencouraging increased violence in football.â
âThese comments endanger player safety and completely contradict extensive scientific study â Schakowsky said in  a letter to  [TGT]    reminding him of the adverse health effects of concussions  which   [TGT] did not mention Friday but has downplayed before.
âConcussions are much more than âa little ding on the head â as you said during your campaign â  she  wrote. âEven repeated and sub-concussive blows to the head  commonplace in football  have been shown to cause lasting neurodegenerative diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This serious disease includes symptoms of impulse control problems  aggression  depression and paranoia. As time passes  CTE continues to degenerate the brain  resulting in memory loss  confusion  impaired judgment and eventually progressive dementia.â
Attached to  the letter   Schakowsky included links to congressional testimony about concussions in sports  as well as a recent study that found an alarming rate of CTE in former NFL players.

âIt is inexcusable to deride systemic efforts to improve player safety â Schakowsky wrote to   [TGT]    whose comments came a day after BUâs CTE Center diagnosed Aaron Hernandez  who committed suicide while serving a life sentence for murder in April  with one of the severest forms of CTE. âThere are real consequences for your reckless comments  and players will pay the price. The time for denying facts and looking the other way is over.â
  [TGT]  has been few and far between .   [TGT]   did elicit a response from Joe Lockhart  the NFL executive vice president of communications and public affairs  who called Trumpâs comments on safety âout of touch.â",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Neutral,,,,,,
5345,Why The GOP Is So Hell,Trump,"Congressional Republicans and President Trump seem hell-bent on pushing through a bill to replace parts of the Affordable Care Act. âDuh â you say  âthe Republicans have been promising to repeal Obamacare since literally the day it was passed.â
Throughout his campaign  Trump promised to repeal Obamacare  although he at times also made outlandish pledges about how he would replace it with a bill that offered coverage to all Americans  which the legislation emerging from the Republican Congress is unlikely to do.
And crucially  a recent Survey Monkey poll conducted for FiveThirtyEight showed that while 89 percent of core  Trump  supporters like how the president is handling health care  only 58 percent of âreluctant  Trump  supporters â feel the same way. These reluctant voters put  Trump  over the top in the Electoral College in 2016 and will play a major role in determining the GOPâs fortunes in 2018  and 40 percent of them disapprove of how  Trump  has handled health care.
Drutman added  âRepublicans understand that Democrats are going to be charged up regardless of whether or not they repeal Obamacare  because âimpeach  Trump .ââ
The current GOP rhetoric about Obamacare â that its markets in many states are collapsing and that therefore Republicans must enact a bill reforming the legislation and rescuing Americans who may be left without coverage â is misleading. While  Trump  and others in  his  party are eager to paint Obamacare as collapsing under its own weight  some insurance companies are publicly saying that one of main reasons they are abandoning the Obamacare marketplaces is that they are not sure that  the Trump administration  will take steps to support  them . And the Republicansâ AHCA bill includes cuts to Medicaid  which has nothing to do with the Obamacare marketplaces.
âConservative politics is now less about ideas or accomplishments than it is about making the right enemies cry out in anguish â wrote Charles Sykes  a longtime conservative radio talk show host  in a recent New York Times op-ed titled âIf Liberals Hate Him  Then  Trump  Must Be Doing Something Right.â (Sykes  who ended his radio show in December and is now a regular commentator on MSNBC  is anti-Trump and leery of conservatives who back the president.)
That is obviously a negative view of todayâs Republican Party. But from 2009-16  one of the core organizing principles of the GOP was opposing Obama. And  Trump  has basked at times in reversing the policies of  his  predecessor  holding high-profile celebrations in the White House Rose Garden after the House passed the AHCA and when  he  announced that the U.S. was withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement. At the latter event   Trump  also knocked liberal elites abroad  making sure to emphasize  he  was reversing Obamaâs climate policies because  he  cared about people in âPittsburgh  not Paris.â
Those competing incentives that are making life difficult for the party at large are reflected more narrowly in what is happening right now in Washington  where Senate Republicans are trying to write a bill that will get 50 of the chamberâs 52 party members behind it. There is a divide between more moderate Republicans  like Alaskaâs Lisa Murkowski  who want to leave some of the Medicaid expansion in place  versus those like Utahâs Mike Lee  who favor a more comprehensive repeal of Obamacare. That kind of conservative-moderate divide is common on many bills  but on health care  there is also a divide between people like Lee and those like  Trump  and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Itâs not clear that  Trump  or McConnell have clearly defined views on health care. So getting a bill through â but not a âmeanâ bill â would both accomplish a key party goal and potentially minimize the political fallout. In contrast  Lee has very specific health policy goals. And he may prefer no bill at all to one that he feels does not repeal enough of Obamacare.","Congressional Republicans and  [TGT]  seem hell-bent on pushing through a bill to replace parts of the Affordable Care Act. âDuh â you say  âthe Republicans have been promising to repeal Obamacare since literally the day it was passed.â

5346,Trump is almost right. He âll get â95 percentâ of black voters â voting against him .,Trump,"President Trump  listens as Isaac Newton Farris Jr.  Martin Luther King Jr.âs nephew  speaks at the White House  Jan. 12. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
In 2016   candidate Donald Trump  declared that if  he  became president  âat the end of four years â when  he  ran for reelection  âI guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African American vote.â
Given  his  performance to date   he âll likely need to add this small corrective: âto vote against me.â
Last week  The Washington Post reported that  Trump  had referred to nations in Africa as âshithole countries â contrasting immigrants from that continent  and from Haiti  with what  he  presumably sees as more desirable immigrants from countries such as Norway. Then on Monday   he  appeared to use Martin Luther King Jr. Day for damage control  lauding Kingâs dream of âa world where people are judged by who they are  not how they look or where they come fromâ in  his  weekly address.
On Tuesday   Trump  patted  himself  on the back  tweeting that recent poll results showed â Trump  approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled.â But as The Postâs Philip Bump explained  thatâs inaccurate. Rather   he  has a 4 percent approval rating among black voters in a new Quinnipiac poll and  according to Gallup  has tumbled from 15 percent approval among black voters a year ago to 6 percent now. Thatâs after being elected with 8 percent of the black vote.
Earlier this month   Trump  disbanded  his  administrationâs dubious voter fraud commission and a day later called for stricter voter identification laws  some of which âtarget African Americans with almost surgical precision â as a federal court concluded in a case from North Carolina.
Global Opinions Editor Karen Attiah says if politicians focus on issues important to black women  everyone will benefit  including President Trump's base. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)
When the 2020 campaign rolls around  no doubt  Trump  will recycle all those claims. But where the president really excels is in compelling black voters to turn out to defeat Republican candidates.
So far  the  Trump  presidency has helped drive black support for Democratic candidates in Virginiaâs gubernatorial race and Alabamaâs senatorial race â the two races watched nationally for signs of how the politics of Trumpism is playing â and it was evident that black Americans were motivated to turn out in higher than typical numbers to deliver the president high-profile losses.
 Trump  has been better at generating black support for the Democratic Party than the Republicansâ own candidates or platform. As The Post reported  black voters in Alabama saw GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore as â the local Trump .â  They  voted specifically to keep  him  from winning  not out of enthusiasm for  his  Democratic opponent  Doug Jones. One black Alabamian told the Atlantic that black voters turned out to reject â Trump  and the resurgence of this white conservative overtly racist rhetoric. We can see it. . . . And you donât have any choice but to beat that back.â
But then the  Trump  presidency settled in. By the time summer was in full swing  black Americans felt the shift into familiar  Trump  territory. There was  his  Charlottesville fail   his  national anthem pandering and  his  botched condolence call to Gold Star widow Myeshia Johnson.
African Americans immediately recognized the pattern. Those lamentable episodes recalled Trumpâs haranguing of the âCentral Park Fiveâ and  his  birther claims against the first black president. But now  Trump  was in the White House. Black citizens have dealt with this sort of thing for centuries from all corners of society  but history shows that racial animus in a sitting American president is especially ominous. This is a hard lesson black Americans learned almost immediately after Emancipation when President Andrew Johnsonâs personal racism undermined Reconstruction from the outset  and  with it  hope of realizing racial equality.
In Virginia  Trumpâs endorsement of Republican Ed Gillespie and the candidateâs stance on Confederate monuments ignited black solidarity in opposition. Democrat Ralph Northam won the governorship  and a surge in black voter turnout was a key component of his victory. As Slateâs Jamelle Bouie noted  black Virginians were  strongly anti-Trump  and turned out to vote against  him .
In Alabama   Trump âs endorsement of Moore  an accused child molester  served as a call to action for black voters  in no small part because of comments Moore made in 2011 expressing disdain for the constitutional amendments that abolished slavery  affirmed black Americansâ citizenship and extended the franchise. When Moore fondly reminisced about the slavery era as a time when black families were âunited â that was the last straw. Black voters put Democrat Doug Jones over the top in a tight contest.
When  Trump  boasts about  his  effect on black voters  the instinct is partly right: Black voters certainly respond to  him . But the response is one of indignation  not admiration.  His  first year in office has brought to the surface some of the worst impulses of our nationâs history and behavior. Black voters will be motivated in 2018 and 2020 to cast votes against  him  and  by extension   his  party. And  Trump  will have no one but  himself  to blame.","[TGT] listens as Isaac Newton Farris Jr.  Martin Luther King Jr.âs nephew  speaks at the White House  Jan. 12.

5347,'Declaration of war': North Korea claims Trump speech brought 'all options' to the table,Trump,"A North Korean official said  President Trump 's comments last week to the United Nations General Assembly amounted to a U.S. ""declaration of war"" against the Hermit Kingdom -- the latest rhetoric in a war of words that comes a day after a propaganda video from Pyongyang featured missiles demolishing a U.S. aircraft and jets.
The 90-second video released on the DPRK Today news site one day after U.S. jets flew over waters east of North Korea  began with images mocking  Trump  before flashing to a submarine-launched missile striking the USS Carl Vinson  Yonhap News Agency reported. The aircraft carrier is seen exploding and disintegrating into pieces.
Those same B-1B bombers stationed in Guam and F-15C Eagle fighter escorts flying out of Okinawa  Japan entered international airspace over waters east of North Korea on Saturday. U.S. Defense Department spokeswoman Dana White said the mission was to send North Korea a âclear messageâ  Trump  has âmany military options to defeat any threat.â
North Koreaâs foreign minister Ri Yong-ho said on Monday that North Korea had the right to shoot down U.S. bombers in its airspace and  Trump 's statements were ""a declaration of war"" against the country.

5348,Report: NYC Foreign Terror Suspect Entered U.S. with 'Diversity Visa' Trump Wants to End,Trump,"The suspected foreign national terrorist behind the New York City attack that has left at least eight individuals dead came to the United States years ago through the Diversity Visa Lottery  a program that President Trump and pro-American immigration reformers have demanded an end to.

However  Elaine Donnelly  president for the Center For Military readiness  said  Trump  ""has every right to review  revise  or repeal  his  predecessor's military transgender policies  which would detract from mission readiness and combat lethality."" Court judges  she said  are not qualified to run the military.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,,,,,,,,,,,

5353,Judge Blocks Trump Administration From Punishing 'Sanctuary Cities' : The Two,Trump,"Judge Blocks Trump Administration From Punishing 'Sanctuary Cities'
 The Trump administration  cannot withhold federal money to punish local governments for  their  noncompliance with immigration authorities  according to a ruling by a federal judge in California.
In  an order announced Monday  Judge William Orrick permanently blocked the policy  issued as one of President Trump's earliest executive orders  ruling it was ""unduly coercive"" and violated the separation of powers.
The judge had previously issued a temporary injunction blocking  the policy   as did a judge in Chicago. "" This order  plows no new ground "" Orrick wrote â although this injunction  unlike the previous ones  is permanent.
In the controversial executive order  signed in January   Trump  sought to deny federal funds to so-called ""sanctuary cities."" Those are jurisdictions that refuse to share some information with federal immigration officials  as a way to partially protect some people who are in the country illegally.
 Trump 's order said such jurisdictions ""are not eligible to receive Federal grants  except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes."" In response  multiple jurisdictions sued the Justice Department  including the city of San Francisco and the county of Santa Clara.
The city and county alleged that  the executive order  was overbroad  unconstitutionally coercive and ""void for vagueness.""
The federal government maintained that a follow-up memo from the attorney general clarified  the policy  and limited  its  scope. In that memo  Jeff Sessions wrote that  the executive order  only applies to grants administered by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security  not all grants  and can't be applied in any way that would violate constitutional authority.
Judge William Orrick ruled against the federal government  writing that  the executive order  was ""unconstitutionally broad"" in  its  effect and evidently coercive. He noted that  Trump  has called  the executive order  a ""weapon"" to wield against cities.
And he rejected the idea that the attorney general's memo made  the executive order  constitutional.
Orrick called the memo an ""illusory promise "" a non-binding document with an ""implausible interpretation"" of the order  which ""does not change the plain meaning"" of  Trump 's words.

 President Donald Trump  plans to halt payments to insurers under the Obama-era health care law that  he  has been trying to unravel for months.
 Trump 's decision is expected to rattle already-unsteady insurance marketplaces.  The president  has previously threatened to end the payments  which help reduce health insurance copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes  but remain under a legal cloud.
 The president 's action is likely to trigger a lawsuit from state attorneys general  who contend the subsidies to insurers are fully authorized by federal law  and  the president 's position is reckless.

5355,Trump to become first foreign leader to dine in Forbidden City since founding of modern China,Trump,"Hong Kong (CNN)  Donald Trump  will receive an honor in Beijing not granted to any US President since the founding of the People's Republic of China: official dinner inside the Forbidden City.
When  Trump  and  his  wife Melania land in the Chinese capital Wednesday   they  will join President Xi Jinping and  his  wife  Peng Liyuan  for a tour of the Forbidden City   the historic palace that housed Chinese emperors and their families for almost 500 years.
 Trump  is expected to dine with Xi inside the Jianfu Palace   although the exact location of the dinner hasn't been confirmed. The building dates back to the eighteenth century and was fully restored in 2005   making it one of the most well-preserved parts of the palace complex.
Wherever  he  dines in the Forbidden City   Trump  will be the first foreign leader to have an official dinner in the palace since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.
Dining in the Forbidden City will be a significant honor for  Trump   in keeping with what China's Ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai promised would be a ""state visit-plus.""
""The Chinese government know who they're dealing with "" said Beijing-based historian Jeremiah Jenne. ""It's another in a long line of fairly shrewd moves by the Chinese government and something ( Trump  is) going to be very impressed with.""
Ming Wang  a professor of government and politics at George Mason University  said the Chinese ""will give  Trump  an exceptional reception  essentially they'll try to make  Trump  happy -- that will work to China's advantage.""
During last year's election campaign   Trump  was a critic of China  but since becoming President -- and especially since meeting with President Xi in April --  he  has softened considerably  toning down  his  rhetoric which once called for harsher trade and economic policies towards Beijing.
""(Xi's) going to treat  Trump  almost like an emperor "" said Ming.

5357,Trump defends vulgar remarks while partly denying them,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â  President Donald Trump  offered a partial denial in public but privately defended  his  extraordinary remarks disparaging Haitians and African countries.
 Trump  said  he  was only expressing what many people think but wonât say about immigrants from economically depressed countries  according to a person who spoke to  the president  as criticism of  his  comments ricocheted around the globe.
 Trump  spent Thursday evening calling friends and outside advisers to judge their reaction  said the confidant  who spoke on condition of anonymity because  he  wasnât authorized to disclose a private conversation.  Trump  wasnât apologetic about the inflammatory remarks and denied  he  was racist  instead  blaming the media for distorting  his  meaning  the confidant said.
Critics of  the president   including some Republicans  on Friday blasted the vulgar comments made in the Oval Office. In a meeting with a group of senators   Trump  had questioned why the U.S. would accept more immigrants from Haiti and âshithole countriesâ in Africa as  he  rejected a bipartisan immigration deal  according to one participant and people briefed on the remarkable conversation.
The comments revived charges that  Trump  is racist and roiled already tenuous immigration talks that included discussion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  or DACA.
âThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough  but this was not the language used â  Trump  insisted in early tweets Friday  pushing back on some depictions of the meeting.
But  Trump  and  his  advisers notably did not dispute the most controversial of  his  remarks: using âshitholeâ to describe African nations and saying  he  would prefer immigrants from countries like Norway instead.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois  the only Democrat in the room  said  Trump  had indeed said what he was reported to have said. The remarks  Durbin said  were âvile  hate-filled and clearly racial in their content.â He said  Trump  used the most vulgar term âmore than once.â
 Trump  last year ended DACA  which provided young immigrants with protection from deportation along with the ability to work legally in the U.S.  He  gave Congress until March to come up with a legislative fix.
The three Democratic and three GOP senators whoâd struck the deal  Trump  rejected had been working for months on how to balance those protections with Trumpâs demands for border security  an end to a visa lottery aimed at increasing immigrant diversity  and limits to immigrantsâ ability to sponsor family members to join them in America.
On Saturday   Trump  sought to blame âall talk and no actionâ Democrats for lack of an immigration deal.
âI donât believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but  day by day  they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad!â  Trump  tweeted from Florida as  he  arrived at  his  private golf club in West Palm Beach.
One of the six senators who crafted the bipartisan deal  Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado  said Saturday that the proposal âhas everything  the president  asked for on the border.â  He  said if  Trump  canât support  it   âitâs difficult to see how we could get  him  to agree to anything that could pass in Congress.â
 Trump  took particular issue with the idea that people whoâd fled to the U.S. after disasters in places such as El Salvador  Guatemala and Haiti would be allowed to stay as part of the deal  according to the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity because they werenât authorized to publicly describe the discussion.
When it came to talk of extending protections for Haitians  Durbin said  Trump  replied: âWe donât need more Haitians.'â
 Trump  insisted Friday that  he  ânever said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is  obviously  a very poor and troubled country. Never said âtake them out.â Made up by Dems.â  Trump  wrote  âI have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings â unfortunately  no trust!â","WASHINGTON (AP) â   [TGT] offered a partial denial in public but privately defended   [TGT]   extraordinary remarks disparaging Haitians and African countries.

In a meeting with a group of senators    [TGT] had questioned why the U.S. would accept more immigrants from Haiti and âshithole countriesâ in Africa as  he  rejected a bipartisan immigration deal  according to one participant and people briefed on the remarkable conversation.
The comments revived charges that   [TGT] is racist and roiled already tenuous immigration talks that included discussion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program  or DACA.
âThe language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough  but this was not the language used â   [TGT]   insisted in early tweets Friday  pushing back on some depictions of the meeting.
But  Trump  and   [TGT]   advisers notably did not dispute the most controversial of   [TGT]   remarks: using âshitholeâ to describe African nations and saying   [TGT]   would prefer immigrants from countries like Norway instead.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois  the only Democrat in the room  said   [TGT] had indeed said what he was reported to have said. The remarks  Durbin said  were âvile  hate-filled and clearly racial in their content.â He said   [TGT]   used the most vulgar term âmore than once.â
  [TGT] last year ended DACA  which provided young immigrants with protection from deportation along with the ability to work legally in the U.S.  He  gave Congress until March to come up with a legislative fix.
The three Democratic and three GOP senators whoâd struck the deal   [TGT] rejected had been working for months on how to balance those protections with Trumpâs demands for border security  an end to a visa lottery aimed at increasing immigrant diversity  and limits to immigrantsâ ability to sponsor family members to join them in America.
On Saturday    [TGT] sought to blame âall talk and no actionâ Democrats for lack of an immigration deal.
âI donât believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but  day by day  they are blowing the one great opportunity they have.  [TGT] tweeted from Florida as   [TGT]   arrived at   [TGT]   private golf club in West Palm Beach.
One of the six senators who crafted the bipartisan deal  Democrat Michael Bennet of Colorado  said Saturday that the proposal âhas everything  the president  asked for on the border.â  He  said if   [TGT]   canât support  it   âitâs difficult to see how we could get  him  to agree to anything that could pass in Congress.â
  [TGT] took particular issue with the idea that people whoâd fled to the U.S. after disasters in places such as El Salvador  Guatemala and Haiti would be allowed to stay as part of the deal  according to the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity because they werenât authorized to publicly describe the discussion.
When it came to talk of extending protections for Haitians  Durbin said   [TGT] replied: âWe donât need more Haitians.'â
  [TGT] insisted Friday that   [TGT]   ânever said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is  obviously  a very poor and troubled country. Never said âtake them out.â Made up by Dems.â   [TGT]   wrote  âI have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings â unfortunately  no trust!â",Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Positive,Positive,Neutral,Neutral,Positive
5358,The State of the Union heard 'round the world (opinion),Donald Trump,"Recent analysis from the Pew Research Center shows that Americans' fundamental political values are increasingly divided on issues like immigration  national security and environmental protection. In  Donald Trump's  first year as president  these gaps have widened.
As expected   Trump  used his speech to argue for his immigration plan  asserting direct links between murderous gangs and illegal immigration. His remarks have serious implications for our relationships abroad -- with countries like Mexico hearing  again  that the administration does not view immigrants as positive contributors to American society.
This is troubling at a moment when a recent Gallup Poll found that a mere 16% of people in Latin America approve of  Trump  and only 24% approve of US leadership writ large (a drop from nearly 50% in 2016). Denigrating some immigrants  as  Trump  did in  his  speech  will undoubtedly push those numbers even lower  which will limit our ability to work with countries like Mexico on areas of shared interest and on shared threats.
Pakistani leaders  on the other hand  still bristling over a recent decision by  Trump  to suspend aid over their government's continued refusal to shut down safe havens for the Taliban and the Haqqani network  most likely breathed a sigh of relief that they were not mentioned.
 Trump  called out and vowed not to repeat the so-called mistakes of previous administrations when it comes to dealing with the accelerated threat posed by Kim Jong Un's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

They  are regularly attacked as religious hypocrites who give Christianity in general  and Evangelical Christianity in particular  a bad name.
Robert P. Jones wrote in USA Today: âWhite Evangelicals . . . are  in many ways  a community grieving its losses. . . .

I believe these attacks are not biblical  moral  or wise.

This is so obvious that only the naÃ¯ve think otherwise. Character is no predictor of political leadership on behalf of moral causes. I wish it were. Then  in any political contest  we would simply have to determine who the better person is and vote accordingly.
Therefore  I would like to pose some questions to critics of Evangelicals who support  Trump :
1. Former President Jimmy Carter has been married once (virtually all critics of  Trump  note that he is thrice married  as if that were ipso facto a character defect)  and to the best of anyoneâs knowledge  has been faithful to his wife all those years. If you are conservative  religious or secular  would you vote for Jimmy Carter over  Donald Trump ?
2. Do you believe that Hillary Clinton has a finer character than  Donald Trump ? For the record  I believe  his  character is superior to hers. And the choice in the 2016 was between  Trump  and Clinton. A Republican who voted for anyone else (or didnât vote) voted for Clinton.","In that vein  this Jew would like to defend   [TGT]  .

5360,Senate to explore president's unchecked nuclear authority,Donald Trump,"Here's a question rarely raised before  Donald Trump  ran for the White House: If  the president  ordered a pre-emptive nuclear strike  could anyone stop  him ?
As Bruce Blair  a former nuclear missile launch officer and expert on nuclear command and control  has put it  ""The protocol for ordering the use of nuclear weapons endows every president with civilization-ending power.""  Trump    he  wrote in a Washington Post column last summer  ""has unchecked authority to order a preventive nuclear strike against any nation  he  wants with a single verbal direction to the Pentagon war room.""
Or  as then-Vice President Dick Cheney explained in December 2008   the president  ""could launch a kind of devastating attack the world's never seen.  He  doesn't have to check with anybody.  He  doesn't have to call the Congress.  He  doesn't have to check with the courts.""
And the world has changed even more in the decade since  with North Korea posing a bigger and more immediate nuclear threat than had seemed possible. The nature of the U.S. political world has changed  too  and  Trump 's opponents â even within  his  own party â question whether  he  has too much power over nuclear weapons.

5363,President Trump has made 2 436 false or misleading claims so far,Trump,"Since taking office   President Trump  has made 2 436 false or misleading claims and flip-flops.  He  now averages 6 per day. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)
In the 406 days since  he  took the oath of office   President Trump  has made 2 436 false or misleading claims  according to The Fact Checkerâs database that analyzes  categorizes and tracks every suspect statement uttered by the president.
When we first started this project for the presidentâs first 100 days   he  averaged 4.9 claims a day. Slowly  the average number of claims has been creeping up.
Our interactive graphic  created with the help of Leslie Shapiro and Kaeti Hinck of the Post graphics department  displays a running list of every false or misleading statement made by  Trump . We also catalogued  the presidentâs  many flip-flops  since those earn Upside-Down Pinocchios if a politician shifts position on an issue without acknowledging  he  or she did so.
As we were updating the database in recent weeks  weâve found ourselves doing something unusual â double checking that we had not entered the same speech twice.  The presidentâs  sales pitch for  his  tax plan has been so consistent it made us do a double take. But consistency does not equal accuracy.
Regardless   the president âs spin seems to have enlightened new believers. Polling indicates a big swing in favor of the new law  with twice as many Americans approving of the law than at the end of 2017.
So as a reader service (and given  the president âs penchant for repetition)  hereâs a summary of  Trumpâs  most frequent false and misleading claims about the tax bill:
If we use a gross domestic product of $19.5 trillion in 2018  which assumes the kind of growth  Trump  expects  the tax cut would be nearly 0.9 percent of GDP. And under those circumstances   Trump âs cut falls behind seven previous tax cuts dating back to 1945. That means   Trumpâs tax cut  is only the eighth largest â certainly not the âbiggest.â  It âs smaller than two of  Obamaâs  tax cuts.
 President Trump  has made this claim 14 times since  he  signed the tax cuts into law.
 He  has repeated it over 64 times since  he  took office.
 Trump  is citing a White House Council of Economic Advisers report that has been widely criticized for the $4 000 estimate. Our friends at FactCheck.org offered a good illustration. Consider this simple arithmetic. There are almost 126 million households in the United States  so an average of $4 000 per household would mean a total income gain of $500 billion. Now that gain  according to the White House  is a direct result of the tax cut. The United States collected just under $300 billion in corporate taxes in fiscal 2017 before the tax bill was passed. If the new corporate tax rate had been in place  the government would have collected $127 billion less. Put another way  companies would have saved $127 billion  but even if they gave every dime back to workers this doesnât come near the $500 billion required to average $4 000 per household. (The White House says this is not a fair comparison because so many companies avoided the U.S. tax rates that current tax receipts are lower than they would be under the new law.)
 President Trump  has made this claim six times since  he  signed the tax cut into law.
 He  has repeated it at least 12 times since taking office.
As we have previously explained  the United States has never been one of the highest-taxed nations  developed or not â and that was before Trumpâs tax cut. The Pew Research Center  using 2014 data  found that the tax bill for Americans  under various scenarios  is below average for developed countries. In 2014  according to comparative tables of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product â the broadest measure of the economy â was 26 percent for the United States. Out of 34 countries  that put the United States in the bottom third â and well below the OECD average of 34.4 percent. Given  the breadth of the Trump tax cut    it âs reasonable to expect the United States will rank even lower in the OECD rankings.
 President Trump  has made this claim at least once since  he  signed the tax cut into law.
 He  has repeated it at least 33 times since taking office.","Since taking office    [TGT] has made 2 436 false or misleading claims and flip-flops.   [TGT]   now averages 6 per day. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)

5364,Trump calls for âbipartisanâ immigration deal for âdreamersâ but reiterates demand for border wall,Trump,"White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders outlined President Trump's priorities on immigration reform on Jan. 4.  (Reuters)
President Trump  on Thursday called on Congress to deliver a bipartisan deal to ensure that some younger undocumented immigrants can remain in the country without fear of deportation  but  he  maintained  his  demand for a border wall and cuts to legal immigration channels that Democrats have opposed.
âI think it can be bipartisan â  Trump  said at the White House ahead of a meeting with Republican senators on immigration. âI hope it can be bipartisan. It can take care of a lot of problems; it would be really nice to do it in a bipartisan way.â
Lawmakers are facing a March 5 deadline to pass legislation to help the dreamers  immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  after  Trump  announced in September  he  would terminate an Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that has provided two-year work permits to hundreds of thousands of them. Nearly 700 000 dreamers had been enrolled in the program and  after March 5  nearly 1 000 per day will lose their work permits unless Congress acts.
[ Trump  takes hard line on âdreamers â but remains interested in a deal]
âIf we have support from Democrats on DACA that would be terrific â  Trump  said. But  the president  emphasized that âany legislation on DACA must secure our border with a wall. It must give our immigration officers the resources they need to stop illegal immigration.â
 He  also reiterated previous calls to end a diversity visa lottery that provides 50 000 green cards a year to immigrants from countries with low immigration rates to the United States. âThe lottery system has to be laughed at by people outside our country â  Trump  said.
[âThis is the momentâ: Dreamers face make-or-break push on immigration fight with  Trump ]
After the meeting at the White House  two Republican senators  Thom Tillis (N.C.) and James Lankford (Okla.) said in a joint statement that the lawmakers and  Trump  are ""on the same page when it comes to security our borders once and for all and providing long-term certainty for DACA youth.""
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said  Trump  would play host to a bipartisan group of Congress members next week to continue the immigration negotiations.
Immigrant rights groups  including those that represent dreamers  have called for a âcleanâ DACA bill that is not attached to the spending bill and does not contain other border security provisions. Congressional Democrats have signaled they are open to some security measures  but they have steadfastly refused to support  Trump 's border wall  saying such a barrier is costly and unnecessary at a time when illegal crossings at the Mexican border are at records lows. Some moderate Republicans are also wary of supporting a wall.
Among the GOP senators meeting with  Trump  was Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.)  who has been supportive of immigration reform efforts that offer a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Trump   in  his  remarks  said Graham âused to be a great enemy of mine; now  he 's a great friend.â
âWe're working with Democrats â  Trump  added. âWe're moving across the aisle. I think we have a lot of support. But we'll soon see. I'd like to take care of DACA  but only under these conditions.â","White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders outlined President Trump's priorities on immigration reform on Jan. 4.   [TGT] 
on Thursday called on Congress to deliver a bipartisan deal to ensure that some younger undocumented immigrants can remain in the country without fear of deportation  but   [TGT]   maintained   [TGT]   demand for a border wall and cuts to legal immigration channels that Democrats have opposed.
âI think it can be bipartisan â   [TGT] said at the White House ahead of a meeting with Republican senators on immigration. âI hope it can be bipartisan. It can take care of a lot of problems; it would be really nice to do it in a bipartisan way.â
Lawmakers are facing a March 5 deadline to pass legislation to help the dreamers  immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  after   [TGT] announced in September   [TGT]   would terminate an Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that has provided two-year work permits to hundreds of thousands of them. Nearly 700 000 dreamers had been enrolled in the program and  after March 5  nearly 1 000 per day will lose their work permits unless Congress acts.
[  [TGT] takes hard line on âdreamers â but remains interested in a deal]
âIf we have support from Democrats on DACA that would be terrific â   [TGT] said. But  the president  emphasized that âany legislation on DACA must secure our border with a wall. It must give our immigration officers the resources they need to stop illegal immigration.â
  [TGT]   also reiterated previous calls to end a diversity visa lottery that provides 50 000 green cards a year to immigrants from countries with low immigration rates to the United States. âThe lottery system has to be laughed at by people outside our country â   [TGT] said.
[âThis is the momentâ: Dreamers face make-or-break push on immigration fight with  Trump ]
After the meeting at the White House  two Republican senators  Thom Tillis (N.C.) and James Lankford (Okla.) said in a joint statement that the lawmakers and   [TGT]   are ""on the same page when it comes to security our borders once and for all and providing long-term certainty for DACA youth.""
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said   [TGT]   would play host to a bipartisan group of Congress members next week to continue the immigration negotiations.
Immigrant rights groups  including those that represent dreamers  have called for a âcleanâ DACA bill that is not attached to the spending bill and does not contain other border security provisions.

5365,Under Trump plan refugees from 11 countries face additional U.S. barriers,Trump,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration will temporarily delay processing of most refugees from 11 countries identified as high-risk  while resuming refugee admissions for other countries  government officials said on Tuesday. Most of the affected countries are in the Middle East and Africa  according to documents seen by Reuters.
The administration also will place on hold a program that allows for family reunification for some refugees resettled in the United States  according to  a Trump administration memo seen by Reuters  and sent to Congress on Tuesday. The resettling of so-called following-to-join refugees will resume  according to  the memo   once screening âenhancements have been implemented.â
The changes come at the close of a 120-day ban on most refugees ordered by  President Donald Trump  to allow a review of vetting processes. The 120 days ended on Tuesday  and  Trump  issued an executive order allowing the general resumption of the U.S. refugee program.
 The memo  expressed concerns about admitting refugees from the 11 countries and said the government will conduct a 90-day review âto determine what additional safeguards  if any  are necessary to ensure ... the security and welfare of the United States.â
 Trump  took office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions  in line with promises he made during the 2016 election campaign. He quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries  which were challenged in court.
Opponents of the bans argued that the policies were aimed at barring Muslims from the United States. The administration has denied any intent to discriminate and says its travel ban and security changes are meant to protect the United States from terrorist acts. The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the last remaining challenge to an earlier version of Trumpâs travel ban.","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  [TGT]  will temporarily delay processing of most refugees from 11 countries identified as high-risk  while resuming refugee admissions for other countries  government officials said on Tuesday.

5366,In trying to fire Mueller  Trump digs his own legal grave,Trump,"Opinion   If  President Trump  were to fire the bane of  his  legal troubles   he  could spark a legal and constitutional crisis. Post Opinion writer Quinta Jurecic lays out how  Trump  could get rid of special counsel Robert Mueller  and what would happen as a result. (Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)
 President Trump  ordered the firing last June of Robert S. Mueller III  the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation  according to four people told of the matter  but ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive. â¦ Mr. [Donald] McGahn disagreed with  the president âs case and told senior White House officials that firing Mr. Mueller would have a catastrophic effect on Mr. Trumpâs presidency. Mr. McGahn also told White House officials that  Mr. Trump  would not follow through on the dismissal on  his  own.  The president  then backed off.
First   Trumpâs  failed attempt to fire Mueller was apparently known to many individuals  indicating both a lack of discipline on  Trumpâs  part (what else did  he  say to these people?) and possible waiver of any privilege. If McGahn can be compelled to discuss such interactions with  Trump  with the special counsel   he  may be able to testify as to the presidentâs motive both in firing FBI Director James B. Comey and attempting to fire Mueller. We should wonder whether McGahn and/or Mueller determined that the privilege was waived because  Trump  had ordered McGahn to do something illegal (i.e. obstruct justice by firing Mueller). It may come as a surprise to  Trump  to learn that no privilege would apply in such a case.
Second  âAttempted obstruction is obstruction even when the perpetrator backs down after failing to get his consigliere to do the deed for him â constitutional lawyer Larry Tribe emails me. âIn addition  itâs part of a persistent pattern of obstruction. And itâs also strong evidence of consciousness of guilt.â As the Times report notes   Trump  has âlong demonstrated a preoccupation with those who have overseen the Russia investigation.â He threw a fit when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe  and he fired Comey after he failed to extract an oath of loyalty. The attempt to decapitate the probe again goes to  Trumpâs  intent to stymie an independent investigation and  his  seeming cluelessness that these actions would be potentially illegal  an abuse of  his  power.
If one is constructing a case evidencing a deliberate  ongoing plan to disrupt and stop the Russia investigation so as to protect  Trump  and  his  family  this is certainly one nugget of damaging information. Norm Eisen  a former White House ethics lawyer  agrees that âit is another piece in the obstruction mosaic. Like the loyalty demand; telling Comey to let [the probe of Michael] Flynn go; or firing Comey  it evinces corrupt intent. What is  Trump  trying to hide? Whatever it is  protecting  himself   family or others is not a proper purpose.â  He  adds  âItâs wrongâ and so is more evidence of the corrupt intent needed to find obstruction.â (Eisen and his colleagues at the Brookings Institution have written a brief on the case for obstruction  which will presumably need to be updated now.)
 President Trump  is acting macho by saying  he 'll testify under oath in the Russia probe  says columnist Ruth Marcus. But won't the real test come down to whether he tells the truth? Marcus joins opinion writers Jonathan Capehart  Christine Emba and Stephen Stromberg in the weekly roundtable  ""It's Only Thursday."" (The Washington Post)
Third   the president  does back down when confronted. On one hand  McGahn should be commended for standing up to  Trump  and should set an example for others who may be pressured to carry out illegal or problematic actions. However  as former director of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub tells me  âBefore anyone goes canonizing McGahn  letâs pause to recall the media reports about  him  pressuring Sessions not to recuse and seeking access to FISA warrant information.â It is not clear whether McGahn simply thought the move would be politically disastrous or if  he  concluded firing  Mueller  would itself constitute obstruction of justice  a crime. As an aside  âItâs also worth noting that this is not the first leak to paint McGahn in a positive light at  Trumpâs  expense â says Shaub. âIf I were  Trump   Iâd find myself wondering about McGahn.â
Fourth  the attempt to fire  Mueller  suggests  Trumpâs  childlike belief that the investigation would not proceed  or would not proceed as effectively  without  Mueller . To the contrary  Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein would have appointed a replacement  and the same FBI investigators would have continued their digging. The files would all be preserved.  Trump  personalizes everything  apparently ignorant of the institutional procedures built into the system to ensure that no one personâs removal can keep the wheels of justice from turning. That inability to recognize organization rules and norms may be his downfall.
Fifth  this underscores how irresponsible Republicans have been in failing to shore up protections for the special counsel. Next time  McGahn may not be there or be able to head off an order to fire  Mueller  when  Trump  loses  his  cool. Republicans â for the presidentâs own protection â need to bring up legislation allowing notice of a decision to fire  Mueller  and/or some procedural recourse if  Trump  does pull the trigger. âWhile credit goes to Don McGahn  this is a blaring alarm: if there was ever any doubt in any Republican leaderâs mind that  Trump  is willing to subvert the rule of law  that is now gone â says Ian Bassin  who heads the nonpartisan group Protect Democracy. âThe question now for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan  Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and their caucuses is whether they truly believe we are a nation of laws and not of men and what theyâre willing to do to assure that.â Unfortunately  from indulging the antics of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) to refusing to set up a select committee  GOP congressional leaders seem to have already answered the question.

5369,Report: Trump lawyer brokered $130 000 payment to porn star,Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) â President Donald Trump's personal lawyer brokered a $130 000 payment to a porn actress to prevent her from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter with  Trump   according to a report Friday in The Wall Street Journal.
 Trump  met Stephanie Clifford  whose goes by the name Stormy Daniels in films  at a golf event in 2006 â a year after  Trump 's marriage to  his  wife  Melania. According to the Journal's report  Clifford began talking with ABC News in the fall of 2016 for a story involving an alleged relationship with  Trump   but reached a $130 000 deal a month before the election  which prevented  her  from going public.
 Trump 's longtime attorney Michael Cohen arranged for the payment through Clifford's lawyer  Keith Davidson  the Journal reported.
Clifford had also been in discussions with the online magazine Slate  The New York Times reported Friday. Jacob Weisberg  editor-in-chief of the Slate Group  told the Times that Clifford had told him she had an affair with  Trump .
In a statement to the Journal  Cohen did not address his role in negotiating the supposed payment but said  Trump  denies any such relationship with Clifford. Clifford has previously denied an alleged relationship with  Trump . Cohen also sent the Journal a statement â signed by ""Stormy Daniels"" â in which the actress denied receiving ""hush money"" from  Trump .
Just days before the 2016 election  the Journal published a story stating that the National Enquirer â run by David Pecker  a fervid supporter of  Trump  â had paid $150 000 to silence former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal about a sexual relationship she allegedly had with  Trump  a decade ago.","[TGT]  brokered a $130 000 payment to a porn actress to prevent  [TGT]  from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter with   [TGT]    according to a report Friday in The Wall Street Journal.

Clifford had also been in discussions with the online magazine Slate  The New York Times reported Friday. Jacob Weisberg  editor-in-chief of the Slate Group  told the Times that Clifford had told him she had an affair with  [TGT]  .
In a statement to the Journal  Cohen did not address his role in negotiating the supposed payment but said   [TGT]   denies any such relationship with Clifford. Clifford has previously denied an alleged relationship with   [TGT]  . Cohen also sent the Journal a statement â signed by ""Stormy Daniels"" â in which the actress denied receiving ""hush money"" from  Trump .
Just days before the 2016 election  the Journal published a story stating that the National Enquirer â run by David Pecker  a fervid supporter of  Trump  â had paid $150 000 to silence former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal about a sexual relationship she allegedly had with  Trump  a decade ago.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,,,,,,,,,,

5371,As Trump announces tariffs Trudeau takes to Davos stage to unveil Canada's new trade deal with Asia,Trump,"DAVOS  Switzerland â Hours after  the Trump administration  announced  its  first major tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a global audience that his country had just reached a historic trade deal with 10 Asia-Pacific countries. The symbolism from Canada was clear: When it comes to trade  the rest of the world is ready to move forward without  President Trump .
Trudeau called the new deal the CPTPP  which stands for the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership. The name was a reminder that Canada and other nations went forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after  Trump  pulled out a year ago. The withdrawal from TPP was one of  Trump 's first acts as president. At the time  experts warned that leaving TPP probably would mean the United States would be outflanked on trade.
 Trump   who has called TPP a âdisasterâ and a ârapeâ of American workers  is scheduled to speak Friday on the same stage at Davos where Trudeau announced his new trade agreement.
Anticipation is high in Davos that  Trump  will announce further trade measures in 2018 â and there is concern about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
âWhat we want is fair trade â  Trump  has said repeatedly. âWe're gonna treat countries fairly  but they have to treat us fairly.â
American  Canadian and Mexican officials are meeting in Montreal this week for a sixth round of talks aimed at renegotiating NAFTA.  Trump  has said the trade agreement  in effect since 1994  hurts U.S. manufacturing and workers.
Burrow is calling for a ânew social contractâ in which governments and businesses give more protections to workers  including the ability to unionize. Her solution differs greatly from  Trump 's push to scale back regulations on businesses.
Many chief executives at Davos say they don't view  Trump 's recent tariffs as the start of a global trade war. They think that the U.S. president is looking to score political points with his base  but that he won't want to upset the stock market record highs and the faster economic growth by putting up too many trade barriers  a move that probably would spook businesses and investors.

5373,AP FACT CHECK: Trump 's tax fiction and embrace of propaganda,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump's rally in Missouri this past week was a set-piece of distortion about taxes and the economy.  He  compounded  his  growing legacy of false tales on Twitter  where  he  spread a British fringe group's factually twisted propaganda aimed at stirring hate and fear of Muslims.
A look at statements from  his  rally Wednesday  the anti-Muslim propaganda  he  retweeted and more:
 TRUMP  describes the tax overhaul as ""the biggest tax cut in the history of our country â bigger than Reagan "" and says of lawmakers: ""For years they have not been able to get tax cuts  many  many years since Reagan.""
In just one area  the Senate bill would slash the tax paid by companies with profits that double as the owner's personal income. These are known as ""pass-through"" companies.  Trump  controls about 500 such entities  according to  his  lawyers. Instead of paying at a top rate of 39.6 percent   Trump  would probably be taxed closer to 30 percent.  He  also stands to get a break on the Alternative Minimum Tax and a modestly lower personal income tax rate.  His  family-managed fortune is bound to benefit from the elimination or reduction of the estate tax.
Over the longer term  the Federal Reserve says 34 firms have added more than $750 billion in capital since 2009. That capital essentially is held in reserves that would help the companies weather a future crisis like the 2008 financial meltdown that prompted steps to overhaul the financial sector. Among those steps was the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  which many Republicans complain is overbearing and which became the subject of a power struggle this past week as  Trump  and Obama-era officials vied for control of it ( Trump  won).
THE FACTS: They failed  twice. Each time Republicans could not summon the votes in their own ranks to get rid of ""Obamacare."" That's when  Trump  and the GOP in Congress turned to a tax overhaul instead. They are almost certain to try again on health care.
Papers signed in China during  Trump 's visit  for example  were largely a packaging of previously worked-out deals  tentative investments  statements of intent and extensions of business with existing Chinese customers  with some new orders. They did not reflect a solution to underlying U.S. grievances about Chinese trading practices.
THE FACTS: The tweet by Jayda Fransen of the anti-Muslim group Britain First is false.  Trump  retweeted it anyway.
The Dutch Embassy responded to  Trump 's dissemination of the video with a tweet directed to him: ""Facts do matter. The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the Netherlands. He received and completed his sentence under Dutch law.""
 TRUMP   asking in a tweet Wednesday whether MSNBC host Joe Scarborough will be fired ""based on the 'unsolved mystery' that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!""
THE FACTS: Authorities decided years ago there's no mystery to investigate  despite  Trump 's insinuation of wrongdoing by Scarborough when he was a congressman in Florida. Lori Klausutis  who worked in Scarborough's Fort Walton Beach congressional office  was found dead in the office in July 2001. An autopsy revealed that Klausutis had an undiagnosed heart condition and a coroner concluded she passed out and hit her head as she fell.

5374,Auto industry tells Trump 'We're winning with NAFTA',Donald Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major automakers  suppliers and auto dealers launched a new coalition on Tuesday to urge  U.S. President Donald Trump  not to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 Trump  has threatened to withdraw from the trade agreement among the United States  Canada and Mexico  which is heavily utilized by automakers that have production and supply chains spread across the three countries.
In the most recent round of talks to renegotiate NAFTA last week   Trump  proposed changes to the rules of origin for autos  which are used to determine how much of a vehicle is made in a certain place. The proposed rules were viewed as untenable for automakers  as well as Mexico and Canada.
The auto industry joins the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business groups that have become more vocal in recent weeks about  Trump âs efforts to change the 23-year-old accord  saying the changes would hurt American jobs.
The Chamber of Commerce accused the  Trump  administration of trying to sabotage the talks with âpoison pill proposals â including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production  and a âsunset clauseâ to force regular negotiations.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier this month the  Trump  administration was focused on trying to get an agreement that was fair but said he had âseen no indication that our partners are willing to make any changes that will result in a rebalancing and a reduction in these huge trade deficits.â

The campaign comes amid rising concern that the  Trump  administration could opt early next year to withdraw after giving six monthsâ notice  a move that could expose automakers who are building trucks in Mexico to high tariffs and impose new tariffs on parts and cars made throughout North America.
 Trump  told the Fox Business Network in an interview that aired Sunday  he  thinks the deal will âprobablyâ be renegotiated  but said  he  will withdraw if it is not fair. âWe canât allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not going to happen anymore â  he  said.

5375,Ugly new details about Trumpâs fury over Russia probe,Donald Trump,"President Donald Trump  says the Justice Department is politically biased against  him . Lawfare Deputy managing editor Quinta Jurecic presents the facts of the investigation  Trump  calls ""fake news."" (Kate Woodsome Adriana Usero/The Washington Post)
Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus has given a remarkable interview published by Vanity Fair that is getting some attention because it confirms once again that the most powerful person in the world is a raging  abusive megalomaniac. We learn that  President Trump  erupted at  his  staff over accurate media coverage of  his  paltry inaugural crowd; that officials competed for the title of most obsequious suck-up to  Trump ; and that  Trump  once commanded Priebus to swat a fly.
But buried in the piece is something potentially more important: revelations that shed light on Trumpâs state of mind at key moments throughout  his  efforts to hamstring the investigation into  Trump  campaign collusion with Russian efforts to sabotage our democracy.
The piece tells us that very early on   Trump  began to âlash out wildlyâ at law enforcement officials who were in a position to investigate  his  administration. Priebus and White House counsel Donald McGahn tried to stall the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey. But Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosensteinâs memo  Vanity Fair reports  gave  Trump  the âpretextâ to go forward.
The word âpretextâ is not used by Priebus. But the piece relies on extensive cooperation from Priebus  which suggests that this may be how Priebus viewed it. As youâll recall  that âpretextâ was Rosensteinâs memo excoriating Comey over the FBIâs mishandling of the Hillary Clinton probe â a memo  Trump  ordered up in a meeting just before firing Comey. If Priebus really viewed this as a âpretext â or believed  Trump  did  youâd think that would be of interest to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III  who is probing whether Trumpâs efforts to derail the investigation constituted obstruction of justice.
âWe already had some evidence that the Rosenstein memo was a pretext in the sense that  Trump  used it as an excuse to fire Comey for other reasons â Eric Posner  a University of Chicago law professor who has co-authored a useful paper on presidential obstruction of justice  told me this morning. âThe material in the Vanity Fair piece reinforces that impression . . . itâs another element that Mueller will want to look at.â
Mueller interviewed Priebus in October. âI suspect that Priebus has already been asked about  Trump âs motivation for firing Comey and almost firing Sessions â Posner told me  referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The Vanity Fair piece  which is adapted from a forthcoming book by Chris Whipple  offers new details on Trumpâs almost-firing of Sessions as well. It reports that  Trump  subjected Sessions to an abusive tirade for failing to protect  him  from the investigation  which was already known.
But the piece adds more. After  Trump  ordered Mueller fired in June by his White House counsel (who refused to carry out Trumpâs directive)   Trump  ordered Priebus to âget Sessionsâ resignation flat out â according to a White House insider. That insider quotes  Trump  saying to Priebus: âDonât give me any bullsâ. Donât try to slow me down like you always do. Get the resignation of Jeff Sessions.â
Priebus talked  Trump  out of it. But if this is right  it shows again that  Trump  may have wanted Sessions out and to replace  him  with an attorney general who would constrain the Mueller probe where Sessions did not. After all   Trump  allegedly had just ordered Mueller fired but had failed to get  his  wish. It will not be easy to prove  Trump  obstructed justice â it will require showing that  he  acted with âcorrupt intentâ and an âimproper purpose â such as protecting  himself  and  his  associates from accountability â but this adds to a pattern that appears to shed light on Trumpâs state of mind in this regard.
âThereâs often a tendency for observers to think that  Trump  is just out of control â Posner told me. âThis [Vanity Fair interview] gave more of an impression of him being instrumentally rational in getting what he wants. The more you think that  Trump  is acting pursuant to a clear plan in  his  mind to protect  himself  and  his  family from these investigations  the more youâll think that  it âs obstruction of justice.â
â He  didnât just scream at people and leave it at that â Posner added of  Trump . â He  did all kinds of things over many months to try to derail the investigation. In a few cases  he  was deterred by  his  aides. But in many cases  he  was able to act. That strengthens the argument that  he  acted  as the law requires  with improper purpose or corrupt intent. It means  he  intended to block this investigation because it threatened  him  politically.â
To be sure  there is a separate set of questions over whether a president can be held criminally liable for obstruction of justice. But this isnât just about that. Itâs also about learning what really happened for the purposes of basic accountability.  Mueller  could end up establishing a pattern of very serious or potentially impeachable misconduct. This would have important political significance (whether or not congressional Republicans act on it  which they probably wonât). And this new interview suggests thatâs a more likely outcome.
* McCONNELL URGES TRUMP NOT TO FIRE KELLY: Despite evidence that Chief of Staff John F. Kelly knew of domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter but did nothing  the Washington Examiner reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is privately urging  Trump  to keep him:
A source familiar with the discussion told the Washington Examiner . . . that McConnell advised  Trump  during a recent phone call to avoid making any significant changes to his senior-level staff . . . the Kentucky Republican later told associates that because of Trumpâs mercurial nature  heâs unsure whether the president will listen to him and others who are advocating for Kelly to stay put.
These victories are also the product of a demobilization of  Trumpâs  own constituency. The hardest of the hardcore  Trump  loyalists are still likely to cast ballots this year. But he also drew support from loyal Republicans and white working-class swing voters. Many of them were not enthralled by him but couldnât abide Hillary Clinton â or were just plain angry. Itâs hard to imagine theyâre overjoyed with the past 13 months.","[TGT] says the Justice Department is politically biased against   [TGT]  .

Mueller interviewed Priebus in October. âI suspect that Priebus has already been asked about   [TGT]  âs motivation for firing Comey and almost firing Sessions â Posner told me  referring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The Vanity Fair piece  which is adapted from a forthcoming book by Chris Whipple  offers new details on Trumpâs almost-firing of Sessions as well. It reports that   [TGT] subjected Sessions to an abusive tirade for failing to protect   [TGT]   from the investigation  which was already known.
But the piece adds more. After   [TGT] ordered Mueller fired in June by his White House counsel (who refused to carry out Trumpâs directive)    [TGT] ordered Priebus to âget Sessionsâ resignation flat out â according to a White House insider. That insider quotes   [TGT]   saying to Priebus: âDonât give me any bullsâ. Donât try to slow me down like you always do. Get the resignation of Jeff Sessions.â
Priebus talked   [TGT]   out of it. But if this is right  it shows again that   [TGT] may have wanted Sessions out and to replace   [TGT]   with an attorney general who would constrain the Mueller probe where Sessions did not. After all    [TGT] allegedly had just ordered Mueller fired but had failed to get   [TGT]   wish. It will not be easy to prove   [TGT] obstructed justice â  [TGT]  will require showing that   [TGT]   acted with âcorrupt intentâ and an âimproper purpose â such as protecting   [TGT]   and   [TGT]   associates from accountability â but this adds to a pattern that appears to shed light on Trumpâs state of mind in this regard.
âThereâs often a tendency for observers to think that  Trump  is just out of control â Posner told me. âThis [Vanity Fair interview] gave more of an impression of him being instrumentally rational in getting what he wants. The more you think that   [TGT] is acting pursuant to a clear plan in   [TGT]   mind to protect   [TGT]   and   [TGT]   family from these investigations  the more youâll think that  it âs obstruction of justice.â
â  [TGT]   didnât just scream at people and leave it at that â Posner added of  [TGT]  . â He  did all kinds of things over many months to try to derail the investigation. In a few cases  he  was deterred by  his  aides. But in many cases  he  was able to act. That strengthens the argument that  he  acted  as the law requires  with improper purpose or corrupt intent. It means  he  intended to block this investigation because it threatened  him  politically.â
To be sure  there is a separate set of questions over whether a president can be held criminally liable for obstruction of justice. But this isnât just about that. Itâs also about learning what really happened for the purposes of basic accountability.  Mueller  could end up establishing a pattern of very serious or potentially impeachable misconduct. This would have important political significance (whether or not congressional Republicans act on it  which they probably wonât). And this new interview suggests thatâs a more likely outcome.
* McCONNELL URGES TRUMP NOT TO FIRE KELLY: Despite evidence that Chief of Staff John F. Kelly knew of domestic abuse allegations against Rob Porter but did nothing  the Washington Examiner reports that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is privately urging  Trump  to keep him:
A source familiar with the discussion told the Washington Examiner . . . that McConnell advised   [TGT]   during a recent phone call to avoid making any significant changes to his senior-level staff . . . the Kentucky Republican later told associates that because of Trumpâs mercurial nature  heâs unsure whether the president will listen to him and others who are advocating for Kelly to stay put.
These victories are also the product of a demobilization of  Trumpâs  own constituency. The hardest of the hardcore   [TGT]   loyalists are still likely to cast ballots this year. But he also drew support from loyal Republicans and white working-class swing voters. Many of them were not enthralled by him but couldnât abide Hillary Clinton â or were just plain angry. Itâs hard to imagine theyâre overjoyed with the past 13 months.",Negative,Neutral,Negative,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Neutral,Negative
